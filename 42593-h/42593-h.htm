<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>

<p>American literature in the larger sense of the term began with
Irving, and, if we count <i>The Sketch Book</i> as the beginning, the
centennial year of its birth is yet four years hence. It has been
a custom, especially among the writers of text-books, to divide
this century into periods, and all have agreed at one point: in the
mid-thirties undoubtedly there began a new and distinct literary
movement. The names given to this new age, which corresponded
in a general way with the Victorian Era in England, have been
various. It has been called the Age of Emerson, the Transcendental
Period, the National Period, the Central Period.
National it certainly was not, but among the other names there is
little choice. Just as with the Victorian Era in England, not
much has been said as to when the period ended. There has been
no official closing, though it has been long evident that all the
forces that brought it about have long since expended themselves
and that a distinctively new period has not only begun but has
already quite run its course.</p>

<p>It has been our object to determine this new period and to
study its distinguishing characteristics. We have divided the
literary history of the century into three periods, denominating
them as the Knickerbocker Period, the New England Period, and
the National Period, and we have made the last to begin shortly
after the close of the Civil War with those new forces and new
ideals and broadened views that grew out of that mighty struggle.</p>

<p>The field is a new one: no other book and no chapter of a book
has ever attempted to handle it as a unit. It is an important
one: it is our first really national period, all-American, autochthonic.
It was not until after the war that our writers
ceased to imitate and looked to their own land for material and
inspiration. The amount of its literary product has been amazing.
There have been single years in which have been turned
out more volumes than were produced during all of the Knickerbocker
Period. The quality of this output has been uniformly
high. In 1902 a writer in <i>Harper's Weekly</i> while reviewing a
book by Stockton dared even to say: "He belonged to that
great period between 1870 and 1890 which is as yet the greatest
in our literary history, whatever the greatness of any future time
may be." The statement is strong, but it is true. Despite
Lowell's statement, it was not until after the Civil War that
America achieved in any degree her literary independence. One
can say of the period what one may not say of earlier periods,
that the great mass of its writings could have been produced nowhere
else but in the United States. They are redolent of the
new spirit of America: they are American literature.</p>

<p>In our study of this new national period we have considered
only those authors who did their first distinctive work before
1892. Of that large group of writers born after the beginning
of the period and borne into their work by forces that had little
connection with the great primal impulses that came from the
Civil War and the expansion period that followed, we have said
nothing. We have given the names of a few of them at the
close of chapter 17, but their work does not concern our study.
We have limited ourselves also by centering our attention upon
the three literary forms, poetry, fiction, and the essay. History
we have neglected largely for the reasons given at the opening of
chapter 18, and the drama for the reason that before 1892 there
was produced no American drama of any literary value.</p>

<p>We would express here our thanks to the many librarians and
assistants who have cooperated toward the making of the book
possible, and especially would we tender our thanks to Professor
R.&nbsp;W. Conover of the Kansas Agricultural College who helped
to prepare the index.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE SECOND DISCOVERY OF AMERICA</span></h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>We are beginning to realize that the Civil War marks a dividing
line in American history as sharp and definitive as that
burned across French history by the Revolution. That the South
had been vastly affected by the war was manifest from the first.
The widespread destruction of property, the collapse of the labor
system, and the fall of the social régime founded on negro slavery,
had been so dramatic and so revolutionary in their results that
they had created everywhere a feeling that the ultimate effects
of the war were confined to the conquered territory. Grady's
phrase, "the new South," and later the phrase, "the end of an
era," passing everywhere current, served to strengthen the impression.
That the North had been equally affected, that there
also an old régime had perished and a new era been inaugurated,
was not so quickly realized. The change there had been undramatic;
it had been devoid of all those picturesque accompaniments
that had been so romantic and even sensational in the
South; but with the perspective of half a century we can see now
that it had been no less thoroughgoing and revolutionary.</p>

<p>The first effect of the war had come from the sudden shifting
of vast numbers of the population from a position of productiveness
to one of dependence. A people who knew only peace and
who were totally untrained even in the idea of war were called
upon suddenly to furnish one of the largest armies of modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
times and to fight to an end the most bitterly contested conflict
of a century. First and last, upwards of two millions of men,
the most of them citizen volunteers, drawn all of them from the
most efficient productive class, were mustered into the federal
service alone. It changed in a moment the entire equilibrium of
American industrial life. This great unproductive army had to
be fed and clothed and armed and kept in an enormously wasteful
occupation. But the farms and the mills and the great transportation
systems had been drained of laborers to supply men
for the regiments. The wheatfields had no harvesters; the Mississippi
the great commercial outlet of the West, had been closed
by the war, and the railroads were insufficient to handle the
burden.</p>

<p>The grappling with this mighty problem wrought a change in
the North that was a revolution in itself. The lack of laborers in
the harvest fields of the Middle West called for machinery, and
the reaper and the mowing machine for the first time sprang into
widespread use; the strain upon the railroads brought increased
energy and efficiency and capital to bear upon the problem of
transportation, and it was swiftly solved. Great meat-packing
houses arose to meet the new conditions; shoes had to be sent to
the front in enormous numbers and to produce them a new and
marvelous machine was brought into use; clothing in hitherto
unheard-of quantities must be manufactured and sent speedily,
and to make it Howe's sewing machine was evolved. It was a
period of giant tasks thrust suddenly upon a people seemingly unprepared.
The vision of the country became all at once enlarged.
Companies were organized for colossal undertakings. Values
and wealth arose by leaps and bounds. Nothing seemed impossible.</p>

<p>The war educated America. It educated first the millions of
men who were enrolled in the armies. With few exceptions the
soldiers were boys who had never before left their native neighborhoods.
From the provincial little round of the farm or the
shop, all in a moment they plunged into regions that to them
were veritable foreign lands to live in a world of excitement and
stress, with ever-shifting scenes and ever-deepening responsibilities,
for three and four and even five years. Whole armies of
young men came from the remote hills of New England. Massachusetts
alone sent 159,000. The diffident country lad was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
trained harshly in the roughest of classrooms. He was forced to
measure himself with men.</p>

<p>The whole nation was in the classroom of war. The imperious
call for leaders of every grade and in all ranks of activity developed
everywhere out of raw material captains of men, engineers,
organizers, business directors, financiers, inventors, directors of
activities, on a scale before undreamed of in America. It was a
college course in which were developed efficiency and self-reliance
and wideness of vision and courage and restless activity, and it
produced a most remarkable generation of men.</p>

<p>The armies in the field and those other armies that handled the
railroads and the mills and the finances and supplies, were sons
all of them of a race that had been doubly picked in the generations
before, for only the bravest and most virile in body and
soul had dared to break from their old-world surroundings and
plunge into the untracked West, and only the fittest of these had
survived the rigors of pioneer days. And the war schooled this
remnant and widened their vision and ground out of them the
provincialism that had held them so long to narrow horizons. It
was not until 1865 that Emerson could write, "We shall not
again disparage America now we have seen what men it will
bear." But the chief difference between these men and the early
men that had so filled him with apprehension in the thirties and
the forties, was in the schooling which had come from the five
years of tension when the very life of the nation was in danger.</p>

<p>The disbanding of the armies was followed by a period of restlessness
such as America had never before known. The whole
population was restless. "War," says Emerson, "passes the
power of all chemical solvents, breaking up the old adhesions
and allowing the atoms of society to take a new order." The war
had set in motion mighty forces that did not stop when peace
was declared. Men who had been trained by the war for the
organizing and directing of vast activities turned quickly to new
fields of effort. The railroads, which had been vastly enlarged
and enriched by the war, pushed everywhere now with marvelous
rapidity; great industries, like the new oil industry, sprang into
wealth and power. The West, lying vast and unbroken almost
from the farther bank of the Mississippi, burst into eager life,
and the tide of migration which even before the war had turned
strongly toward this empire of the plains quickly became a flood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
Railroads were pushed along the wild trails and over the Rocky
Mountains. The first transcontinental road was completed in
1868. The great buffalo herds were exterminated in the late
sixties and early seventies; millions of acres of rich land were
preëmpted and turned over to agriculture; the greatest wheat
and corn belts the world has ever known were brought into production
almost in a moment; bridges were flung over rivers and
cañons; vast cities of the plain arose as by magic. Everywhere
a new thrill was in the air. The Civil War had shaken America
into eager, restless life. Mark Twain, who was a part of it all,
could say in later days: "The eight years in America from 1860
to 1868 uprooted institutions that were centuries old, changed the
politics of a people, transformed the social life of half the country,
and wrought so profoundly upon the entire national character
that the influence cannot be measured short of two or three
<span class="locked">generations."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>To-day we can begin to see the effect which the mighty exodus
that followed the war had upon the East. It was little short of
revolution. New England had taken the leading place in precipitating
the struggle between the States, and she had done it
for conscience' sake, and now, though she had won all she had
asked, by a curious turn of fate she was repaid for her moral
stand by the loss of her leadership and later almost of her identity,
for the westward movement that followed the war was in
New England a veritable exodus. There had always been emigration
from the older States and it had gradually increased
during the gold rush period and the Kansas-Nebraska excitement,
but the tide had never been large enough to excite apprehension.
Now, however, all in a moment the stream became a torrent which
took away, as does all emigration from older lands, the most
active and fearless and progressive spirits. Whole districts of
farming land were deserted with all their buildings and improvements.
New Hampshire in 1860 had a population of 326,073;
in 1870 the population had shrunk to 318,300, and that despite
the fact that all the cities and manufacturing towns in the State
had grown greatly during the ten years, the increase consisting
almost wholly of foreigners. According to Sanborn, "more than
a million acres cultivated in 1850 had gone back to pasturage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
and woodland in 1900."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> All growth since the war has been
confined to the cities and the larger manufacturing towns, and
this growth and the supplying of the deficit caused by the emigration
of the old stock have come from an ever-increasing influx
of foreigners. Boston has all but lost its old identity. In Massachusetts
in 1900 nearly one-half of the population was born of
foreign parentage. New England in a single generation lost its
scepter of power in the North, and that scepter gradually has
been moving toward the new West.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>But the change wrought by the war was far more than a rise
of new activities and a shifting of population. A totally new
America grew from the ashes of the great conflict. In 1860,
North and South alike were provincial and self-conscious. New
York City was an enormously overgrown village, and Boston and
Philadelphia and Charleston were almost as individual and as
unlike one another as they had been in the days of the Revolution.
There had been nothing to fuse the sections together and to bring
them to a common vision. The drama of the settlement had been
fierce and piteous, but it had been a great series of local episodes.
The Revolution had not been a melting pot that could fuse all the
sections into a unity. The war which had begun in New England
had drifted southward and each battle, especially toward the end,
had been largely a local affair. Until 1860, there had been no
passion fierce enough to stir to the very center of their lives all
of the people, to melt them into a homogeneous mass, and to pour
them forth into the mold of a new individual soul among the
nations. The emphasis after 1870 was not upon the State but
upon the <i>Nation</i>. As early as 1867 a writer in the <i>North American
Review</i> declared that, "The influence of our recent war in
developing the 'National Sentiment' of the people can hardly be
<span class="locked">overestimated."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span> Now there came national banks, national securities,
a national railroad, a national college system,&mdash;everywhere
a widening horizon. Provincialism was dying in every
part of the land.</p>

<p>Until 1860, America had been full of the discordant individuality
of youth. Its characteristics, all of them, had been characteristics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
of that turbulent, unsettled period before character had
hardened into its final form. From 1820 to 1860 the nation was
adolescent. In everything at least that concerned its intellectual
life it was imitative and dependent. It was in its awkward era,
and like every youth was uncouth and sensitive and self-conscious.
It asked eagerly of every foreign visitor, "And what do
you think of us?" and when the answer, as in the case of Moore
or Marryat or Dickens, was critical, it flew into a passion. It
was sentimental to silliness. As late as 1875 the editor of <i>Scribner's</i>
declared that a large number of all the manuscripts submitted
to publishing houses and periodicals were declined because
of their sentimentality, and most of the published literature of
the time, he added, has "a vast deal of sentimentality sugared
through it." That was in 1875; a few years before that date
Griswold had published his <i>Female Poets of America</i>, and there
had flourished the <i>Token</i>, the <i>Forget-Me-Not</i>, and the <i>Amaranth</i>.
Adolescence is always sad:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And I think as I sit alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While the night wind is falling around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a cold white gleaming stone<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And a long, lone, grassy mound.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">The age had sighed and wept over <i>Charlotte Temple</i>, a romance
which went through edition after edition, and which, according
to Higginson, had a greater number of readers even in 1870 than
any single one of the Waverley Novels.</p>

<p>But even as it sighed over its <i>Charlotte Temple</i> and its <i>Rosebud</i>
and its <i>Lamplighter</i>, it longed for better things. It had
caught a glimpse, through Irving and Willis and Longfellow and
others, of the culture of older lands. America had entered its
first reading age. In 1844 Emerson spoke of "our immense
reading and that reading chiefly confined to the productions of
the English press." In its eagerness for culture it enlarged its
area of books and absorbed edition after edition of translations
from the German and Spanish and French. It established everywhere
the lyceum, and for a generation America sat like an eager
school-girl at the feet of masters&mdash;Emerson and Beecher and
Taylor and Curtis and Phillips and Gough.</p>

<p>But adolescent youth is the period, too, of spiritual awakenings,
of religious strugglings, and of the questioning and testing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
of all that is established. For a period America doubted all
things. It read dangerous and unusual books&mdash;Fourier, St.
Simon, Swedenborg, Jouffroy, Cousin. It challenged the dogmas
of the Church. It worked over for itself all the fundamentals
of religion. A reviewer in the first volume of <i>Scribner's</i> remarks
of the fall books that, as usual, theology has the best of it. "Our
poets write theology, our novels are theological ... even our
statesmen cannot write without treating <span class="locked">theology."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span> The forties
and fifties struggled with sensitive conscience over the great problems
of right and wrong, of altruism and selfish ambition. The
age was full of dreams; it longed to right the wrongs of the weak
and the oppressed; to go forth as champions of freedom and
abstract right; and at last it fought it out with agony and sweat
of blood in the midnight when the stars had hid themselves seemingly
forever.</p>

<p>The Civil War was the <i>Sturm und Drang</i> of adolescent America,
the Gethsemane through which every earnest young life must
pass ere he find his soul. He fails to understand the spirit of
our land who misses this great fact: America discovered itself
while fighting with itself in a struggle for things that are not
material at all, but are spiritual and eternal. The difference between
the America of 1850 and that of 1870 is the difference
between the youth of sixteen and the man of thirty. Before the
war the bands of America had played "Annie Laurie" and
"Drink to Me only with Thine Eyes"; after the war they played
"Rally round the Flag" and "Mine Eyes have Seen the Glory
of the Coming of the Lord."</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>The effect of the war upon American literature has been variously
estimated. Stedman has been quoted often: "The Civil
War was a general absorbent at the crisis when a second group
of poets began to form. The conflict not only checked the rise
of a new school, but was followed by a time of languor in which
the songs of Apollo seemed trivial to those who had listened to
the shout of <span class="locked">Mars."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span> It was Richardson's opinion that "little
that was notable was added to the literature of the country by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
the Civil War of 1861.... The creative powers of our best
authors seemed somewhat benumbed, though books and readers
multiplied between 1861 and 1865."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> And Greenough White
dismisses the matter with the remark that "after the war, Bryant,
Longfellow, and Taylor, as if their power of original production
was exhausted, turned to <span class="locked">translation."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>All this lacks perspective. Stedman views the matter from
the true mid-century standpoint. Poetry to Stedman and Stoddard
and Hayne and Aldrich and Taylor was an esoteric, beautiful
thing to be worshiped and followed for itself alone like a
goddess, a being from another sphere than ours, to devote one's
soul to, "like the lady of Shalott," to quote Stevenson, "peering
into a mirror with her back turned on all the bustle and glamour
of reality." Keats had been the father of this group of poets
which had been broken in upon rudely by the war, and it had
been the message of Keats that life with its wretchedness and commonplaceness
and struggle was to be escaped from by means of
Poesy:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Away! away! for I will fly to thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But on the viewless wings of Poesy.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">But poetry is the voice of life; it is not an avenue by which to
escape from life's problems. The poet springs from his times and
voices his era because he must. If his era smothers him, then so
much the less poet he. No war can check the rise of a new school
of poets if the soul of that new age is one to be expressed in
poetry.</p>

<p>What Stedman and the others failed to see was the new American
soul which had been created by the war and which the new
school, trained in the old conceptions of poetry, was powerless to
voice. If the creative powers of the leading authors were
numbed, if Bryant and Longfellow and Taylor felt that their
power of original production was exhausted and so turned to
translation, it was because they felt themselves powerless to take
wing in the new atmosphere.</p>

<p>The North before the war had been aristocratic in its intellectual
life, just as the South had been aristocratic in its social
régime. Literature and oratory and scholarship had been accomplishments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
of the few. J.&nbsp;G. Holland estimated in 1870 that the
lecturers in the widespread lyceum system when it was at its
highest point, "those men who made the platform popular and
useful and apparently indispensable, did not number more than
twenty-five." The whole New England period was dominated
by a handful of men. The Saturday Club, which contained the
most of them, had, according to Barrett Wendell, twenty-six members
"all typical Boston gentlemen of the Renaissance." Howells
characterizes it as a "real aristocracy of intellect. To say
Prescott, Motley, Parkman, Lowell, Norton, Higginson, Dana,
Emerson, Channing, was to say patrician in the truest and often
the best sense, if not the largest." It is significant that these
were all Harvard men. The period was dominated by college
men. In addition to the names mentioned by Howells, there
might be added from the New England colleges, Webster, Ticknor,
Everett, Bancroft, Hawthorne, Longfellow, Holmes, Parker,
Clarke, Phillips, Sumner, Thoreau, Parsons, and Hale. Excepting
Poe, who for a time was a student at the University of Virginia
and at West Point, and Whittier, who was self-educated,
and two women, Margaret Fuller and Mrs. Stowe, who lived in
the period when colleges were open only for men, the list contains
all the leading authors of the mid-period in America.</p>

<p>With few exceptions these names come from what Holmes denominates
"the Brahmin caste of New England," a term which
he uses to distinguish them from what he called "the homespun
class"&mdash;"a few chosen families against the great multitude."
"Their family names are always on some college catalogue or
other." From 1830 to 1870 the creation of literature was very
little in the hands of the masses; it was in the hands of these
scholars, of this small and provincial "aristocracy of intellect."
Holmes, who gloried in the fact that he lived in Boston, "the hub
of the universe," on Beacon Street, "the sunny street that holds
the sifted few," may be taken as a type of this aristocracy. It
was a period of the limited circle of producers, and of mutual
admiration within the circumference of that circle. Each member
of the group took himself with great seriousness and was
taken at his own valuation by the others. When the new democratic,
after-the-war America, in the person of Mark Twain,
came into the circle and in the true Western style made free with
sacred personalities, he was received with frozen silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
The school, on the whole, stood aloof from the civil and religious
activities of its period. With the exception of Whittier,
who was not a Brahmin, the larger figures of the era took interest
in the great issues of their generation only when these issues
had been forced into the field of their emotions. They were
bookish men, and they were prone to look not into their hearts
or into the heart of their epoch, but into their libraries. In 1856,
when America was smoldering with what so soon was to burst
out into a maelstrom of fire, Longfellow wrote in his journal,
"Dined with Agassiz to meet Emerson and others. I was amused
and annoyed to see how soon the conversation drifted off into
politics. It was not till after dinner in the library that we got
upon anything really <span class="locked">interesting."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span> The houses of the Brahmins
had only eastern windows. The souls of the whole school
lived in the old lands of culture, and they visited these lands as
often as they could, and, returning, brought back whole libraries
of books which they eagerly translated. Even Lowell, the most
democratic American of the group, save Whittier, wrote from
Paris in 1873, "In certain ways this side is more agreeable to
my tastes than the other." And again the next year he wrote
from Florence: "America is too busy, too troubled about many
things, and Martha is only good to make puddings."</p>

<p>Howells in his novel, <i>A Woman's Reason</i>, has given us a view
of this American worship of Europe during this period. Says
Lord Rainford, who has been only in Boston and Newport: "I
find your people&mdash;your best people, I suppose they are&mdash;very
nice, very intelligent, very pleasant&mdash;only talk about Europe.
They talk about London, and about Paris, and about Rome; there
seems to be quite a passion for Italy; but they don't seem interested
in their own country. I can't make it out.... They
always seem to have been reading the <i>Fortnightly</i>, and the <i>Saturday
Review</i>, and the <i>Spectator</i>, and the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>,
and the last French and English books. It's very odd."</p>

<p>Europe colors the whole epoch. Following Irving's <i>Sketch
Book</i>, a small library was written by eager souls to whom Europe
was a wonderland and a dream. Longfellow's <i>Outre Mer</i> and
<i>Hyperion</i>, Tuckerman's <i>Italian Sketch Book</i>, Willis's <i>Pencillings
by the Way</i>, Cooper's <i>Gleanings in Europe</i>, Sanderson's <i>Sketches
of Paris</i>, Sprague's <i>Letters from Europe</i>, Colton's <i>Four Years in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
Great Britain</i>, Taylor's <i>Views Afoot</i>, Bryant's <i>Letters of a Traveller</i>,
Curtis's <i>Nile Notes of a Howadji</i>, Greeley's <i>Glances at
Europe</i>, Mrs. Stowe's <i>Sunny Memories of Foreign Lands</i>, Norton's
<i>Notes of Travel and Study in Italy</i>, Hawthorne's <i>Our Old
Home</i>, Calvert's <i>Scenes and Thoughts in Europe</i>, and, after the
war, Howells's <i>Venetian Life</i>, and Hay's <i>Castilian Days</i> are only
the better-known books of the list. "Our people," complained
Emerson, "have their intellectual culture from one country and
their duties from another," and it was so until after the Civil
War had given to America a vision of her own self. <i>Innocents
Abroad</i> was the first American book about Europe that stood
squarely on its own feet and told what it saw without sentimentality
or romantic colorings or yieldings to the conventional.
After <i>Innocents Abroad</i> there were no more rhapsodies of
Europe.</p>

<p>America was a new land with a new message and new problems
and a new hope for mankind&mdash;a hope as great as that which had
fired the imagination of Europe during the years of the French
Revolution, yet American writers of the mid-century were content
to look into their books and echo worn old themes of other lands.
The Holmes who in his youth had written <i>Old Ironsides</i> was
content now with <i>vers de société</i>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I'm a florist in verse, and what <i>would</i> people say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I came to a banquet without my bouquet?<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">And with the thrill and rush of a new nation all about him,
Stoddard could sit in his study turning out pretty Herrick-like
trifles like this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Why are red roses red?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For roses once were white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because the loving nightingales<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sang on their thorns all night&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sang till the blood they shed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had dyed the roses red.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">It was a period when both Europe and America were too much
dominated by what Boyesen called "the parlor poet," "who
stands aloof from life, retiring into the close-curtained privacy
of his study to ponder upon some abstract, bloodless, and sexless
theme for the edification of a <i>blasé</i>, over-refined public with
nerves that can no longer relish the soul-stirring passions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
emotions of a healthy and active humanity." In Europe, the
reaction from this type of work came with Millet, the peasant
painter of France, with Tolstoy and the Russian realists, with
Balzac and Flaubert in France, with Hardy in England, with
Ibsen and Björnson in Norway, workers with whom art was life
itself.</p>

<p>America especially had been given to softness and sentimentalism.
During the mid-century era, the period of Longfellow, the
lusty new nation, which was developing a new hope for all mankind,
had asked for bread and it had been given all too often
"lucent syrops tinct with cinnamon." The oratory had been
eloquent, sometimes grandiloquent. The prose, great areas of
it, had been affected, embellished with a certain florid youngmanishness,
a honey-gathering of phrases even to the point of bad
taste, as when Lowell wrote of Milton: "A true Attic bee, he
made boot on every lip where there was a taste of truly classic
honey." It was the time when ornateness of figure and poeticalness
of diction were regarded as essentials of style.</p>

<p>To understand what the Civil War destroyed and what it created,
at least in the field of prose style, one should read the two
orations delivered at the dedication of the Gettysburg battle-field.
Here was the moment of transition between the old American literature
and the new. Everett, the eloquent voice of New England,
correct, polished, fervid, massing perfect periods to a climax,
scholarly, sonorous of diction, studied of movement, finished,
left the platform after his long effort, satisfied. The eyes of the
few who could judge of oratory as a finished work of art had
been upon him and he had stood the test. Then had come for a
single moment the Man of the West, the plain man of the people,
retiring, ungainly, untrained in the smooth school of art, voicing
in simple words a simple message, wrung not from books but
from the depths of a soul deeply stirred, and now, fifty years
later, the oration of Everett can be found only by reference
librarians, while the message of Lincoln is declaimed by every
school-boy.</p>

<p>The half-century since the war has stood for the rise of nationalism
and of populism, not in the narrower political meanings
of these words, but in the generic sense. The older group
of writers had been narrowly provincial. Hawthorne wrote to
Bridge shortly before the war: "At present we have no country....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
The States are too various and too extended to form
really one country. New England is really as large a lump of
earth as my heart can take <span class="locked">in."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span> The war shook America awake,
it destroyed sectionalism, and revealed the nation to itself. It
was satisfied no longer with theatrical effects without real feeling.
After the tremendous reality of the war, it demanded genuineness
and the truth of life. A new spirit&mdash;social, dramatic,
intense&mdash;took the place of the old dreaming and sentiment and
sadness. The people had awakened. The intellectual life of
the nation no longer was to be in the hands of the aristocratic,
scholarly few. Even while the war was in progress a bill had
passed Congress appropriating vast areas of the public lands for
the establishment in every State of a college for the people "to
promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial
classes in the several pursuits and professions of life," and it
is significant that Lincoln, the first great President of the people,
signed the bill.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The chief output of the new era was in the form of realistic
fiction. America, shaken from narrow sectionalism and contemplation
of Europe, woke up and discovered America. In a kind
of astonishment she wandered from section to section of her own
land, discovering everywhere peoples and manners and languages
that were as strange to her even as foreign lands. Mark Twain
and Harte and Miller opened to view the wild regions and wilder
society of early California and the Sierra Nevadas; Eggleston
pictured the primitive settlements of Indiana; Cable told the
romance of the Creoles and of the picturesque descendants of
the Acadians on the bayous of Louisiana; Page and Harris and
F.H. Smith and others caught a vision of the romance of the old
South; Allen told of Kentucky life; Miss French of the dwellers
in the canebrakes of Arkansas; and Miss Murfree of a strange
people in the Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee. In twenty
years every isolated neighborhood in America had had its chronicler
and photographer.</p>

<p>The spirit of the New America was realistic. There had been
dreaming and moonlight and mystery enough; now it wanted
concrete reality. "Give us the people as they actually are.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
Give us their talk as they actually talk it," and the result was
the age of dialect&mdash;dialect poetry, dialect fiction, dialect even to
coarseness and profanity. The old school in the East stood
aghast before what they termed this "Neo-Americanism," this
coarse "new literature of the people." Holland in 1872 found
"Truthful James" "deadly wearisome." He hoped that the
poet had "found, as his readers have, sufficient amusement in the
'Heathen Chinee' and the 'Society upon the Stanislaus' and is
ready for more serious work." From this wearisome stuff he
then turned to review in highest terms Stoddard's <i>Book of the
East</i>, a land which Stoddard had never visited save in dreams.</p>

<p>The reviewer of Maurice Thompson's <i>Hoosier Mosaics</i> four
years later speaks of the author as a promising acquisition to
"the invading Goths from over the mountains." Stedman
viewed the new tide with depression of soul. In a letter to Taylor
in 1873 he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Lars</i> is a poem that will <i>last</i>, though not in the wretched, immediate
<i>fashion</i> of this demoralized American period. Cultured as are Hay
and Harte, they are almost equally responsible with "Josh Billings"
and the <i>Danbury News</i> man for the present <i>horrible</i> degeneracy of the
public taste&mdash;that is, the taste of the present generation of
book-buyers.</p>

<p>I feel that this is not the complaint of a superannuated Roger de
Coverley nor Colonel Newcome, for I am in the prime and vigor of
active, noonday life, and at work right here in the metropolis. It is
a clear-headed, wide-awake statement of a disgraceful fact. With it
all I acknowledge, the demand for good books also increases and such
works as Paine's <i>Septembre</i>, etc., have a large standard sale. But in
poetry readers have tired of the past and don't see clearly how to shape
a future; and so content themselves with going to some "Cave" or
"Hole in the Wall" and applauding slang and nonsense, spiced with
smut and <span class="locked">profanity.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>This is an extreme statement of the conditions, but it was
written by the most alert and clear-eyed critic of the period, one
who, even while he deplored the conditions, was wise enough to
recognize the strength of the movement and to ally himself with
it. "Get hold of a dramatic American theme," he counsels
Taylor, "merely for policy's sake. The people want Neo-Americanism;
we must adopt their system and elevate it." Wise advice
indeed, but Taylor had his own ideals. After the failure
of <i>The Masque of the Gods</i> he wrote Aldrich: "If this public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
won't accept my better work, I must wait till a new one grows
up.... I will go on trying to do intrinsically good things, and
will not yield a hair's breadth for the sake of conciliating an
ignorant <span class="locked">public."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></span></p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>The exploiting of new and strange regions, with their rough
manners, their coarse humor, and their uncouth dialects, brought
to the front the new, hard-fought, and hard-defended literary
method called realism. For a generation the word was on every
critic's pen both in America and abroad. No two seemed perfectly
to agree what the term really meant, or what writers were
to be classed as realists and what as romanticists. It is becoming
clearer now: it was simply the new, young, vigorous tide which
had set in against the decadent, dreamy softness that had ruled
the mid years of the century.</p>

<p>The whole history of literature is but the story of an alternating
current. A new, young school of innovators arises to
declare the old forms lifeless and outworn. Wordsworth at the
opening of the nineteenth century had protested against unreality
and false sentiment&mdash;"a dressy literature, an exaggerated
literature" as Bagehot expressed it&mdash;and he started the
romantic revolt by proposing in his poems "to choose incidents
and situations from common life, and to relate or describe them,
throughout, as far as was possible in a selection of language really
used by men." Revolt always has begun with the cry "back to
nature"; it is always the work of young men who have no reverence
for the long-standing and the conventional; and it is
always looked upon with horror by the older generations. Jeffrey,
in reviewing the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>, said that the "Ode on
Intimations of Immortality" was "beyond doubt the most illegible
and unintelligible part of the publication. We can pretend
to give no analysis or explanation of it." At last the revolt triumphs,
and as the years go on its ideas in turn are hardened
into rules of art. Then suddenly another group of daring young
souls arises, and, setting its back upon the old, blazes out a new
pathway toward what it considers to be truth and nature and
art. This new school of revolt from the old and outworn we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
call always the new romantic movement. It is only the new generation
pressing upon the old, and demanding a fresh statement
of life in terms of truth to present conditions.</p>

<p>In America, and indeed in Europe as well, the early seventies
called for this new statement of art. No more <i>Hyperions</i>, no
more conceits and mere prettinesses, no more fine phrasing, no
more castles in Spain, but life real and true, naked in its absolute
faithfulness to facts. It was a revolt. If we call the age of
Longfellow a romantic period, then this revolt of the seventies
was a <i>new</i> romanticism, for romanticism always in broadest sense
is a revolution against orthodoxy, against the old which has
been so long established that it has lost its first vitality and become
an obedience to the letter rather than to the spirit.</p>

<p>The new movement seemed to the Brahmins of the older school
a veritable renaissance of vulgarity. Even Lowell, who had written
the <i>Biglow Papers</i>, cried out against it. The new literature
from the West and the South was the work of what Holmes had
called "the homespun class," "the great multitude." It was
written, almost all of it, by authors from no college. They had
been educated at the printer's case, on the farm, in the mines,
and along the frontiers. As compared with the roll of the Brahmins
the list is significant: Whitman, Warner, Helen Jackson,
Stockton, Shaw, Clemens, Piatt, Thaxter, Howells, Eggleston,
Burroughs, F.&nbsp;H. Smith, Hay, Harte, Miller, Cable, Gilder, Allen,
Harris, Jewett, Wilkins, Murfree, Riley, Page, Russell. The
whole school thrilled with the new life of America, and they wrote
often without models save as they took life itself as their model.
Coarse and uncouth some parts of their work might be, but teeming
it always was with the freshness, the vitality, and the vigor of
a new soil and a newly awakened nation.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The new period began in the early seventies. The years of
the war and the years immediately following it were fallow so
far as significant literary output was concerned. "Literature
is at a standstill in America, paralyzed by the Civil War," wrote
Stedman in 1864, and at a later time he added, "For ten years
the new generation read nothing but newspapers." The old
group was still producing voluminously, but their work was done.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
They had been borne into an era in which they could have no
part, and they contented themselves with reëchoings of the old
music and with translations. In 1871 <i>The London School Board
Chronicle</i> could declare that, "The most gifted of American
singers are not great as creators of home-bred poetry, but as
translators," and then add without reservation that the best
translations in the English language had been made in America.
It was the statement of a literal fact. Within a single period of
six years, from 1867 to 1872, there appeared Longfellow's <i>Divina
Commedia</i>, C.&nbsp;E. Norton's <i>Vita Nuova</i>, T.&nbsp;W. Parsons' <i>Inferno</i>,
Bryant's <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i>, Taylor's <i>Faust</i> and C.&nbsp;P.
Cranch's <i>Æneid</i>.</p>

<p>It was the period of swan songs. Emerson's <i>Terminus</i> came
in 1866; <i>Last Poems</i> of the Cary sisters, Longfellow's <i>Aftermath</i>
and Whittier's <i>Hazel Blossoms</i> appeared in 1874; and Holmes's
<i>The Iron Gate</i> was published in 1880. Lowell, the youngest of
the group, alone seemed to have been awakened by the war.
His real message to America, the national odes and the essays
on Democracy which will make his name permanent in literature,
came after 1865, and so falls into the new period.</p>

<p>The decade from 1868 is in every respect the most vital and
significant one in the history of America. The tremendous
strides which were then made in the settlement of the West, the
enormous increase of railroads and steamships and telegraphs,
the organization of nation-wide corporations like those dealing
with petroleum and steel and coal&mdash;all these we have already
mentioned. America had thrown aside its provincialism and had
become a great neighborhood, and in 1876 North, South, East,
and West gathered in a great family jubilee. <i>Scribner's Monthly</i>
in 1875 commented feelingly upon the fact:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>All the West is coming East.... The Southern States will be similarly
moved.... There will be a tremendous shaking up of the people,
a great going to and fro in the land.... The nation is to be brought
together as it has never been brought before during its history. In one
hundred years of intense industry and marvelous development we have
been so busy that we never have been able to look one another in the
face, except four terrible years of Civil War.... This year around
the old family altar at Philadelphia we expect to meet and embrace as
<span class="locked">brothers.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
The Centennial quickened in every way the national life. It
gave for the first time the feeling of unity, the realization that
the vast West, the new South, and the uncouth frontier were a
vital part of the family of the States. Lowell, so much of whose
early heart and soul had been given to Europe, discovered America
in this same Centennial year. In Cincinnati he was profoundly
impressed with the "wonderful richness and comfort
of the country and with the distinctive Americanism that is
molding into one type of feature and habits so many races that
had widely diverged from the same original stock.... These
immense spaces tremulous with the young grain, trophies of
individual, or at any rate unorganized, courage and energy, of
the people and not of dynasties, were to me inexpressibly impressive
and even touching.... The men who have done and
are doing these things know how things should be done.... It
was very interesting, also, to meet men from Kansas and Nevada
and California, and to see how manly and intelligent they were,
and especially what large heads they had. They had not the
manners of Vere de Vere, perhaps, but they had an independence
and self-respect which are the prime element of fine <span class="locked">bearing."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></span>
A little of a certain Brahmin condescension toward Westerners
there may be here, but on the whole it rings true. The East
was discovering the West and was respecting it.</p>

<p>And now all of a sudden this Neo-Americanism burst forth into
literature. There is a similarity almost startling between the
thirties that saw the outburst of the mid-century school and the
vital seventies that arose in reaction against it. The first era
had started with Emerson's glorification of the American scholar,
the second had glorified the man of action. The earlier period
was speculative, sermonic, dithyrambic, eloquent; the new America
which now arose was cold, dispassionate, scientific, tolerant.
Both had arisen in storm and doubt and in protest against the
old. Both touched the people, the earlier era through the sentiments,
the later through the analytical and the dramatic faculties.
In the thirties had arisen <i>Godey's Lady's Book</i>; in the
seventies <i>Scribner's Monthly</i>.</p>

<p>So far as literature was concerned the era may be said really
to have commenced in 1869 with <i>Innocents Abroad</i>, the first book
from which there breathed the new wild spirit of revolt. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
1870 came Harte's <i>Luck of Roaring Camp</i>, thrilling with the new
strange life of the gold coast and the Sierra Nevada, and Warner's
<i>My Summer in a Garden</i>, a transition book fresh and delightful.
Then in 1871 had begun the deluge: Burroughs's
<i>Wake-Robin</i>, with its new gospel of nature; Eggleston's <i>Hoosier
Schoolmaster</i>, fresh with uncouth humor and the strangeness of
the frontier; Harte's <i>East and West Poems</i>; Hay's <i>Pike County
Ballads</i>, crude poems from the heart of the people; Howells's
first novel, <i>Their Wedding Journey</i>, a careful analysis of actual
social conditions; Miller's <i>Songs of the Sierras</i>; Carleton's <i>Poems</i>;
King's <i>Mountaineering in the Sierra Nevada</i>, a book of travel
glorifying not Europe but a picturesque section of America; and
the completed version of Leland's <i>Hans Breitmann's Ballads</i>, a
book which had waited fourteen years for a publisher who had
the courage to bring it out. In 1873 came Celia Thaxter's
<i>Poems</i>, Aldrich's <i>Marjorie Daw</i>, H.&nbsp;H.'s <i>Saxe Holm Stories</i>, Wallace's
<i>Fair God</i> and O'Reilly's <i>Songs of the Southern Seas</i>; in
1875 James's <i>Passionate Pilgrim</i>, Thompson's <i>Hoosier Mosaics</i>,
Gilder's <i>The New Day</i>, Lanier's <i>Poems</i>, Catherwood's <i>A Woman
in Armor</i>, Woolson's <i>Castle Nowhere</i> and Irwin Russell's first
poem in <i>Scribner's</i>; in 1877 Burnett's <i>That Lass o' Lowrie's</i> and
Jewett's <i>Deephaven</i>; in 1878 Craddock's <i>The Dancing Party at
Harrison's Cove</i> in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, Richard M. Johnston's
<i>Life of Stephens</i>; in 1879 Cable's <i>Old Creole Days</i>, Tourgee's
<i>Figs and Thistles</i>, Stockton's <i>Rudder Grange</i>, and John Muir's
<i>Studies in the Sierras</i>, in <i>Scribner's</i>. All the elements of the
new era had appeared before 1880.</p>

<p>The old traditions were breaking. In 1874 the editorial chair
of the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, the exclusive organ of the old New
England régime, was given to a Westerner. In 1873 came the
resurgence of Whitman. The earlier school had ignored him,
or had tolerated him because of Emerson, but now with the new
discovery of America he also was discovered, and hailed as a
pioneer. The new school of revolt in England&mdash;Rossetti, Swinburne,
Symonds&mdash;declared him a real voice, free and individual,
the voice of all the people. Thoreau also came into his true place.
His own generation had misunderstood him, compared him with
Emerson, and neglected him. Only two of his books had been
published during his lifetime and one of these had sold fewer than
three hundred copies. Now he too was discovered. In the words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
of Burroughs, "His fame has increased steadily since his death
in 1862, as it was bound to do. It was little more than in the
bud at that time, and its full leaf and flowering are not yet."</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>The new age was to express itself in prose. The poetry of the
earlier period, soft and lilting and romantic, no longer satisfied.
It was effeminate in tone and subject, and the new West, virile
and awake, defined a poet, as Wordsworth had defined him in
1815, as "a man speaking to men." America, in the sturdy
vigor of manhood, wrestling with fierce realities, had passed the
age of dreaming. It had now to deal with social problems, with
plans on a vast scale for the bettering of human conditions, with
the organization of cities and schools and systems of government.
It was a busy, headlong, multitudinous age. Poetry, to interest
it, must be sharp and incisive and winged with a message. It
must be lyrical in length and spirit, and it must ring true.
If it deal with social themes it must be perfect in characterization
and touched with genuine pathos, like the folk songs of
Riley and Drummond, or the <i>vers de société</i> of Bunner and
Eugene Field. If it touch national themes, it must be strong
and trumpet clear, like the odes of Lowell and Lanier. It must
not spring from the far off and the forgot but from the life of
the day and the hour, as sprung Whitman's Lincoln elegies,
Joaquin Miller's "Columbus," and Stedman's war lyrics. Not
many have there been who have brought message and thrill, but
there have been enough to save the age from the taunt that it
was a period without poets.</p>

<p>In a broad sense, no age has ever had more of poetry, for the
message and the vision and thrill, which in older times came
through epic and lyric and drama, have in the latter days come
in full measure through the prose form which we call the novel.
As a form it has been brought to highest perfection. It has been
found to have scope enough to exercise the highest powers of a
great poet, and allow him to sound all the depths and shallows
of human life. It has been the preacher of the age, the theater,
the minstrel, and the social student, the prophet and seer and
reformer. It has been more than the epic of democracy; it has
been horn-book as well and shepherd's calendar. It has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
the literary form peculiarly fitted for a restless, observant, scientific
age.</p>

<p>The influence of Dickens, who died in 1870, the opening year
of the period, cannot be lightly passed over. It had been his
task in the middle years of the century to democratise literature,
and to create a reading public as Addison had done a century
earlier, but Addison's public was London, the London that breakfasted
late and went to the coffee house. Dickens created a reading
public out of those who had never read books before, and the
greater part of it was in America. His social novels with their
break from all the conventions of fiction, their bold, free characterization,
their dialect and their rollicking humor and their
plentiful sentiment, were peculiarly fitted for appreciation in
the new after-the-war atmosphere of the new land. Harte freely
acknowledged his debt to him and at his death laid a "spray of
Western pine" on his grave. The grotesque characters of the
Dickens novels were not more grotesque than the actual inhabitants
of the wild mining towns of the Sierras or the isolated
mountain hamlets of the South, or of many out-of-the-way districts
even in New England. The great revival of interest in
Dickens brought about by his death precipitated the first wave
of local color novels&mdash;the earliest work of Harte and Eggleston
and Stockton and the author of <i>Cape Cod Folks</i>.</p>

<p>This first wave of Dickens-inspired work, however, soon expended
itself, and it was followed by another wave of fiction even
more significant. In the first process of rediscovering America,
Harte, perhaps, or Clemens, or Cable, stumbled upon a tremendous
fact which was destined to add real classics to American literature:
America was full of border lands where the old régime
had yielded to the new, and where indeed there was a true atmosphere
of romance. The result was a type of fiction that was
neither romantic nor realistic, but a blending of both methods,
a romanticism of atmosphere and a realism of truth to the actual
conditions and characters involved.</p>

<p>This condition worked itself out in a literary form that is seen
now to be the most distinctive product of the period. The era
may as truly be called the era of the short story as the Elizabethan
period may be called the era of the drama and the early eighteenth
century the era of the prose essay. The local color school which
exploited the new-found nooks and corners of the West and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
South did its work almost wholly by means of this highly wrought
and concentrated literary form. Not half a dozen novelists of
the period have worked exclusively in the novel and romance
forms of the mid-century type. A group of writers, including
Harte, Clemens, Cable, Mrs. Cooke, Miss Jewett, Mrs. Wilkins-Freeman,
Miss Brown, Miss Murfree, Harris, R.&nbsp;M. Johnston,
Page, Stockton, Bierce, Garland, Miss King, Miss French, Miss
Woolson, Deming, Bunner, Aldrich, have together created what
is perhaps the best body of short stories in any language.</p>

<p>The period at its end tended to become journalistic. The enormous
demand for fiction by the magazines and by the more
ephemeral journals produced a great mass of hastily written and
often ill considered work, but on the whole the literary quality
of the fiction of the whole period, especially the short stories, has
been high. Never has there been in any era so vast a flood of
books and reading, and it may also be said that never before has
there been so high an average of literary workmanship.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE LAUGHTER OF THE WEST</span></h2>

<p>American literature from the first has been rich in humor.
The incongruities of the new world&mdash;the picturesque gathering
of peoples like the Puritans, the Indians, the cavaliers, the Dutch,
the negroes and the later immigrants; the makeshifts of the frontier,
the vastness and the richness of the land, the leveling effects
of democracy, the freedom of life, and the independence of spirit&mdash;all
have tended to produce a laughing people. The first really
American book, Irving's <i>Knickerbocker's History of New York</i>,
was a broadly humorous production. The mid period of the
nineteenth century was remarkably rich in humor. One has only
to mention Paulding and Holmes and Saxe and Lowell and Seba
Smith and B.&nbsp;P. Shillaber. Yet despite these names and dozens
of others almost equally deserving, it must be acknowledged that
until the Civil War period opened there had been no school of
distinctly American humorists, original and nation-wide. The
production had been sporadic and provincial, and it had been read
by small circles. The most of it could be traced to older prototypes:
Hood, Thackeray, Lamb, Douglas Jerrold, Dickens. The
humor of America, "new birth of our new soil," had been discovered,
but as yet it had had no national recognition and no
great representative.</p>

<p>As late as 1866, a reviewer of "Artemus Ward" in the <i>North
American Review</i>, published then in Boston, complained that
humor in America had been a local product and that it had been
largely imitative. It was time, he declared, for a new school of
humorists who should be original in their methods and national
in their scope. "They must not aim at copying anything; they
should take a new form.... Let them seek to embody the wit
and humor of all parts of the country, not only of one city where
their paper is published; let them force Portland to disgorge
her Jack Downings and New York her Orpheus C. Kerrs, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
benefit of all. Let them form a nucleus which will draw to
itself all the waggery and wit of <span class="locked">America."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></span> It was the call
of the new national spirit, and as if in reply there arose the new
school&mdash;uncolleged for the most part, untrained by books, fresh,
joyous, extravagant in its bursting young life&mdash;the first voice of
the new era.</p>

<p>The group was born during the thirties and early forties, that
second seedtime of American literature. Their birth dates fall
within a period of ten years:</p>

<table class="dates" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl">1833.</td><td class="tdl">David Ross Locke, "Petroleum V. Nasby."</td></tr>

</table>

<p>To the school also belonged several who were born outside of
this magic ten years. There were Henry Wheeler Shaw, "Josh
Billings," born in 1818; and Charles Henry Smith, "Bill Arp,"
born in 1823. At least three younger members must not be omitted:
Robert Jones Burdette, 1844; Edgar Wilson Nye, "Bill
Nye," 1850; and Opie Read, 1852.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>In a broad way the school was a product of the Civil War.
American humor had been an evolution of slow growth, and the
war precipitated it. The election of Lincoln in 1860 was the
beginning. Here was a man of the new West who had worked
on flatboats on the Ohio, who had served as a soldier in a backwoods
troop, who had ridden for years on a Western circuit, and
in rough and ready political campaigns had withstood the heckling
of men who had fought barehanded with the frontier and
had won. The saddest man in American history, he stands as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
one of the greatest of American humorists. His laughter rings
through the whole period of the war, man of sorrows though he
was, and it was the Western laughter heard until now only along
the great rivers and the frontier and the gold coast of the Pacific.
He had learned it from contact with elemental men, men who
passed for precisely what they were, men who were measured
solely by the iron rule of what they could do; self-reliant men,
healthy, huge-bodied, deep-lunged men to whom life was a joy.
The humor that he brought to the East was nothing new in America,
but the significant thing is that for the first time it was placed
in the limelight. A peculiar combination it was, half shrewd
wisdom, "hoss sense," as "Josh Billings" called it, the rest
characterization which exposed as with a knife-cut the inner life
as well as the outer, whimsical overstatement and understatement,
droll incongruities told with all seriousness, and an irreverence
born of the all-leveling democracy of the frontier.</p>

<p>"It was Lincoln's opinion that the finest wit and humor,
the best jokes and anecdotes, emanated from the lower orders of
the country <span class="locked">people,"<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></span> and in this judgment he pointed out the
very heart of the new literature that was germinating about him.
Such life is genuine; it rests upon the foundations of nature
itself. Lincoln, like the man of the new West that he was, delighted
not so much in books as in actual contact with life.
"Riding the circuit for many years and stopping at country
taverns where were gathered the lawyers, jurymen, witnesses,
and clients, they would sit up all night narrating to each other
their life adventures; and the things which happened to an
original people, in a new country, surrounded by novel conditions,
and told with the descriptive power and exaggeration which
characterized such men, supplied him with an exhaustless fund
of anecdotes which could be made applicable for enforcing or
refuting an argument better than all the invented stories of the
<span class="locked">world."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the new humor of the West for the first time shown to
the whole world. Lincoln, the man of the West, had met the
polished East in the person of Douglas and had triumphed
through very genuineness, and now he stood in the limelight
of the Presidency, transacting the nation's business with anecdotes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
from the frontier circuits, meeting hostile critics with
shrewd border philosophy, and reading aloud with unction, while
battles were raging or election returns were in doubt, from
"Artemus Ward," or "Petroleum Vesuvius Nasby," or <i>The
Flush Times of Alabama and Mississippi</i>&mdash;favorites of his because
they too were genuine, excerpts not from books but from
life itself.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Glimpses there already had been of the new humor of the
West. George W. Harris (1814&ndash;1868), steamboat captain on
the Tennessee River, had created that true child of the West,
"Sut Lovengood"; Augustus B. Longstreet (1790&ndash;1870) in
<i>Georgia Scenes</i> had drawn inimitable sketches of the rude life of
his region; and Joseph G. Baldwin (1815&ndash;1864), like Lincoln,
himself a lawyer who had learned much on his frontier circuit,
in his <i>Flush Times</i> had traced the evolution of a country barrister
in a manner that even now, despite its echoes of Dickens,
makes the book a notable one.</p>

<p>But the greatest of them all, the real father of the new school
of humorists, the man who gave the East the first glimpse of the
California type of humor, was George Horatio Derby (1823&ndash;1861),
whose sketches over the signature "John Ph&oelig;nix" began
to appear in the early fifties. Undoubtedly it would amaze
Derby could he return and read of himself as the father of the
later school of humor. With him literary comedy was simply a
means now and then of relaxation from the burdens of a strenuous
profession. He had been graduated from West Point in
1846, had fought in the Mexican War, and later as an engineer
had been entrusted by the government with important surveys
and explorations in the far West and later in Florida, where he
died at the age of thirty-eight of sunstroke. He was burdened
all his life with heavy responsibilities and exacting demands
upon his energies. He had little time for books, and his writings,
what few he produced, were the result wholly of his own observations
upon the picturesque life that he found about him in the
West.</p>

<p>In his <i>Ph&oelig;nixiana</i>, published in 1855, we find nearly all of the
elements that were to be used by the new school of humorists.
First, there is the solemn protestation of truthfulness followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
by the story that on the face of it is impossible. "If the son
of the reader ... should look confidingly into his parent's face,
and inquire&mdash;'Is that true, Papa?' reply, oh, reader, unhesitatingly&mdash;'My
son, it is.'" To make the story still more plausible
he quotes "Truthful James." He may then proceed with a
story like this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He glanced over the first column [of Ph&oelig;nix's <i>Pictorial</i>] when he
was observed to grow black in the face. A bystander hastened to seize
him by the collar, but it was too late. Exploding with mirth, he was
scattered into a thousand fragments, one of which striking him probably
inflicting some fatal injury, as he immediately expired, having
barely time to remove his hat, and say in a feeble voice, "Give this to
Phoenix." A large black tooth lies on the table before us, driven
through the side of the office with fearful violence at the time of the
explosion. We have enclosed it to his widow with a letter of condolence.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">"<i>Truthful James</i>"&mdash;we think of Bret Harte, and we think of
him again after passages like this: "An old villain with a bald
head and spectacles punched me in the abdomen; I lost my
breath, closed my eyes, and remembered nothing further."</p>

<p>Derby was the first conspicuous writer to use grotesque exaggerations
deliberately and freely as a provocative of laughter.
Irving and many others had made use of it, but in <i>Ph&oelig;nixiana</i>
it amounts to a mannerism. He tells the most astonishing impossibilities
and then naïvely adds: "It is possible that the circumstances
may have become slightly exaggerated. Of course,
there can be no doubt of the truth of the main incidents." In
true California style he makes use often of specific exaggeration.
Two men trip over a rope in the dark "and then followed
what, if published, would make two closely printed royal octavo
pages of profanity." So popular was the Ph&oelig;nix <i>Herald</i> that
"we have now seven hundred and eighty-two Indians employed
night and day in mixing adobe for the type molds."</p>

<p>The second characteristic of Derby's humor was its irreverence.
To him nothing was sacred. The first practical joker, he averred,
was Judas Iscariot: he <i>sold</i> his Master. Arcturus, he observed,
was a star "which many years since a person named Job was
asked if he could guide, and he acknowledged he couldn't do it."
"David was a Jew&mdash;hence, the 'Harp of David' was a Jew's-harp."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
He delights in the device of euphemistic statement used so
freely by later humorists. The father of Joseph Bowers, he
explains, was engaged in business as a malefactor in western
New York, but was annoyed greatly by the prejudices of the
bigoted settlers. He emigrated suddenly, however, with such
precipitation in fact that "he took nothing with him of his large
property but a single shirt, which he happened to have about
him at the time he formed his resolution." Finally he "ended
his career of usefulness by falling from a cart in which he had
been standing, addressing a numerous audience, and in which
fall he unfortunately broke his neck."</p>

<p>He abounds in true Yankee aphorisms&mdash;"when a man is going
down, everybody lends him a kick," "Where impudence is wit,
'tis folly to reply." He uses unexpected comparisons and whimsical
<i>non sequiturs</i>: he sails on "a Napa steam packet of four
cat-power"; "the wind blew," he declared, "like well-watered
roses." R.&nbsp;W. Emerson, he was informed, while traveling
in upper Norway, "on the 21st of June, 1836, distinctly saw the
sun in all its majesty shining at midnight!&mdash;in fact, all night.
Emerson is not what you would call a superstitious man, by any
means&mdash;but, he left."</p>

<p>It was Derby who wrote the first Pike County ballad. "Suddenly
we hear approaching a train from Pike County, consisting
of seven families, with forty-six wagons, each drawn by thirteen
oxen." Elsewhere he has described the typical "Pike": "His
hair is light, not a 'sable silvered,' but a <i>yeller</i>, gilded; you can
see some of it sticking out of the top of his hat; his costume is
the national costume of Arkansas, coat, waistcoat, and pantaloons
of homespun cloth, dyed a brownish yellow, with a decoction
of the bitter barked butternut&mdash;a pleasing alliteration; his
countenance presents a determined, combined with a sanctimonious
expression." "Now rises o'er the plains in mellifluous accents,
the grand Pike County Chorus:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span></p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, we'll soon be thar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the land of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the forest old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the mounting cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With spirits bold&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, we come, we come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we'll soon be thar.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Gee up, Bolly! whoo, up, whoo haw!"<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>Not much was added to Western humor after Derby. Mark
Twain's earliest manner had much in it that smacks of "Ph&oelig;nix."
The chapters entitled, "Ph&oelig;nix Takes an Affectionate
Leave of San Francisco," "Ph&oelig;nix is on the Sea," and "Ph&oelig;nix
in San Diego" might have been taken from <i>Roughing It</i>.
Just as truly the chapters, "Inauguration of the New Collector"
and "Return of the Collector," "Thrilling and Frantic Excitement
Among Office Seekers" might have been written by Orpheus
C. Kerr. Yet despite such similarities, the later school did
not necessarily filch from "Ph&oelig;nix": they learned their art as
he had learned it from contact with the new West. All drew
from the same model.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>For the new humor, which was to be the first product of the
new period in American literature, was Western humor of the
"John Ph&oelig;nix" type. It came from three great seed places:
the Mississippi and its rivers, the California coast, and, later,
the camps of the Civil War. It was the humor of the gatherings
of men under primitive conditions. It was often crude and
coarse. It was elemental and boisterous and often profane. To
the older school of poets and scholars in the East it seemed, as it
began to fill all the papers and creep even into the standard
magazines, like a veritable renaissance of vulgarity. "The
worlds before and after the Deluge were not more different than
our republics of letters before and after the <span class="locked">war,"<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></span> wrote Stedman
to William Winter in 1873, and the same year he wrote to
Taylor in Europe, "The whole country, owing to <i>contagion</i>
of our American newspaper 'exchange' system, is flooded, deluged,
swamped, beneath a muddy tide of slang, vulgarity, inartistic
bathers [<i>sic</i>], impertinence, and buffoonery that is not <span class="locked">wit."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Many of the new humorists had been born in the East, but all of
them had been drilled either in the rough school of the West or
in the armies during the war. Shaw had been a deckhand on
an Ohio River steamer; Browne had been a tramp printer both
in the East and the West, and had lived for a time in California;
Clemens had been tramp printer, pilot on the Mississippi, and
for five years miner and newspaper man on the Western coast;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Webb and Nye and Newell had seen life in California; Locke
had edited country papers in northern Ohio, and C.&nbsp;H. Smith,
Landon, Bailey, Sweet, Lewis, and Burdette had been soldiers
in the Civil War. All of them had been thrown together with
men under circumstances that had stripped them and the life
about them of all the veneer of convention and class distinction.</p>

<p>One thing the group had in common: they were newspaper
men; most of them had worked at the case; all of them at one
time or another were connected with the press. The new humor
was scattered by the newspapers that after the war spread themselves
in incredible numbers over America. The exchange system,
complained of by Stedman, became nation wide. The good
things of one paper were seized upon by the others and sown
broadcast. Humorous departments became more and more common,
until staid old papers like the <i>Boston Advertiser</i> had yielded
to the popular demand. The alarm voiced by Stedman in his
letter to Taylor was taken up by the more conservative magazines.
The humor of to-day is written for the multitude, complained
the ponderous old <i>North American Review</i>, "that uncounted
host which reads for its romance <i>The Ledger</i> and <i>The
Pirate of the Gulf</i>. Common schools make us a nation of readers.
But common schools, alas! do little to inculcate taste or
discrimination in the choice of reading. The mass of the community
has a coarse digestion.... It likes horse-laughs."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> But
it is useless to combat the spirit of the age.</p>

<p>The wave rolled on until it reached its height in the mid seventies.
From journals with an incidental humorous column
there had arisen the newspaper that was quoted everywhere and
enormously subscribed for solely because of the funny man in
charge. The <i>Danbury News</i>, the local paper of a small Connecticut
city, swelled its subscription list to 40,000 because of its
editor Bailey. The vogue of such a paper was not long. At
different periods there arose and flourished and declined "Nasby's"
<i>Toledo Blade</i>, "Lickshingle's" <i>Oil City Derrick</i>, Burdette's
<i>Burlington Hawkeye</i>, "M. Quad's" <i>Detroit Free Press</i>, Peck's
<i>Sun</i>, Sweet's <i>Texas Siftings</i>, Read's <i>Arkansaw Traveller</i>, and
many others.</p>

<p>The greater part of this newspaper humor was as fleeting as
the flying leaves upon which it was printed. It has disappeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
never to be regathered. Even the small proportion of it that
was put by its authors into book form has fared little better.
From all the host of literary comedians that so shook the period
with laughter not over four have taken anything even approaching
a permanent place. These four are Browne, Locke, Nast,
and Shaw.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Charles Farrar Browne, "Artemus Ward," the first of the
group to gain recognition, was born of Puritan ancestry in
Waterville, Maine, in 1834. Forced by the death of his father
in 1847 to rely upon his own efforts for support, he became a
typesetter on the Skowhegan <i>Clarion</i>, and later, after a wandering
career from office to office, served for three years in Boston
as a compositor for Snow and Wilder, the publishers of <i>Mrs.
Partington's Carpet Bag</i>. His connection with Shillaber, the
editor of this paper, turned his mind to humorous composition,
but it was not until after his second wander period in the South
and West that he discovered the real bent of his powers. His
career as a humorist may be said to have begun in 1857, when,
after two years at Toledo, Ohio, he was called to the local editorship
of the Cleveland <i>Plain-Dealer</i> and given freedom to inject
into the dry news columns all the life and fun that he chose.
He began now to write articles purporting to describe the struggles
and experiences of one "Artemus Ward," an itinerant showman
who was as full of homely wisdom and experience as he was
lacking in book learning and refinement. The letters instantly
struck a popular chord; they were copied widely. After serving
three years on the <i>Plain-Dealer</i> their author was called to New
York to become the editor of the brilliant but ill-starred comic
magazine, <i>Vanity Fair</i>. The following year, 1861, he began
to lecture, and in 1863 and 1864 he made a six-months' lecture
tour of the Pacific Coast. The free, picturesque life of the new
cities and the wild camps delighted him. In Virginia City he
spent three marvelous weeks with Mark Twain, then a reporter
on the local paper. Returning across the Plains, he visited the
Mormons. The trip was the graduate course of the young humorist.
Not until after his California training was he completely
in command of his art. Then in 1866 at the height of his powers
he went to London, where his success was instant and unprecedented.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
He was made an editor of <i>Punch</i>, he was discussed
in all quarters, and his lectures night by night were attended by
crowds. But the end was near. He died of quick consumption
March 6, 1867.</p>

<p>The secret of Browne's success as a humorist lay, first of all,
in the droll personality of the man. It was the opinion of
Haweis, who heard him in London, that his "bursts of quaint
humor could only live at all in that subtle atmosphere which
Artemus Ward's presence created, and in which alone he was
able to <span class="locked">operate."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></span> He made use of all the humorous devices of
his favorite, John Ph&oelig;nix, and to them he added what may be
called the American manner of delivering humor: the setting
forth with perfect gravity and even mournfulness his most telling
jokes and then the assuming of a surprised or even a grieved expression
when the audience laughed.</p>

<p>Furthermore, to Ph&oelig;nix's devices he added cacography, the
device of deliberate misspelling so much used by later humorists.
He seems to have adopted it spontaneously as a matter of course.
He was to take the character of an ignorant showman and naturally
he must write as such a man would write. The misspelling
of "Artemus Ward" has character in it. In his hands it
becomes an art, and an art that helps make vivid the personality
of the old showman. "Artemus Ward" is not a mere Dickens
gargoyle: he is alive. Witness this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If you say anything about my show say my snaiks is as harmliss
as the new born Babe.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>In the Brite Lexington of yooth, thar aint no sich word as fale.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>"Too troo, too troo!" I answered; "it's a scanderlis fact."</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">He is not at all consistent in his spelling; he is as prodigal as
nature and as careless. The mere uninspired cacographist misspells
every word that it is possible to misspell, but Browne picks
only key words. His art is displayed as much in the words he
does not change as in those with which he makes free. He coins
new words with telling effect. Of his wife he observes: "As
a flap-jackist she has no equal. She wears the belt." And he
makes free with older words in a way that is peculiarly his own:
"Why this thusness."</p>

<p>The third element he added to the humor of Ph&oelig;nix was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
naïve drollery, a whimsical incongruity, that was peculiar to
himself. He caught it from no one, and he imparted it to no
one. It can be described only as "Artemus Ward." It lives
even apart from his presence in much of the writing that he has
left behind him. It is as useless to try to analyze it as it were
to describe the odor of apples. One can only quote examples, as
for instance this from his adventure "Among the Free Lovers":</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The exsentric female then clutched me frantically by the arm and
hollered:</p>

<p>"You air mine, O you air mine!"</p>

<p>"Scacely," I sed, endeverin to git loose from her. But she clung to
me and sed:</p>

<p>"You air my Affinerty!"</p>

<p>"What upon arth is that?" I shouted.</p>

<p>"Dost thou not know?"</p>

<p>"No, I dostent!"</p>

<p>"Listin man &amp; I'll tell ye!" sed the strange female; "for years I hav
yearned for thee. I knowd thou wast in the world sumwhares, tho I
didn't know whare. My hart sed he would cum and I took courage.
He <i>has</i> cum&mdash;he's here&mdash;you air him&mdash;you air my Affinerty! O 'tis
too mutch! too mutch!" and she sobbed agin.</p>

<p>"Yes," I anserd, "I think it is a darn sight too mutch!"</p>

<p>"Hast thou not yearned for me?" she yelled, ringin her hands like
a female play acter.</p>

<p>"Not a yearn!" I bellerd at the top of my voice, throwin her away
from me.</p></blockquote>

<p>Whatever we may think of the quality of this, we must agree
that it is original. If there is any trace of a prototype it is
Dickens. The characters and the situation are heightened to
grotesqueness, yet one must be abnormally keen in palate to
detect any Dickens flavor in the style. It is "Artemus Ward"
and only "Artemus Ward." All that he wrote he drew from
life itself and from American life. It is as redolent of the new
world as the bison or the Indian. He wrote only what had passed
under his eye and he wrote only of persons. Unlike Mark
Twain, he could cross the continent in the wild days of '64 and
see nothing apparently but humanity.</p>

<p>The world of Charles Farrar Browne was the child's world
of wonder. He was a case, as it were, of arrested development, a
fragment of the myth-making age brought into the nineteenth
century. His "Artemus Ward" was a latter-day knight-errant
traveling from adventure to adventure. The world to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
even as to a child, was full of strange, half mythical beings:
Shakers, Spiritualists, Octoroons, Free Lovers, Mormons, Champions
of Woman's Rights, Office Seekers, "Seseshers," Princes,
and heirs to Empires. The hero is tempted, imposed upon, assaulted,
but he always comes out first best and turns with copious
advice which is always moral and sensible and appropriate. To
the woman who had claimed him as her affinity he speaks thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I'm a lawabiding man, and bleeve in good, old-fashioned institutions.
I am marrid &amp; my orfsprings resemble me, if I am a showman! I
think your Affinity bizniss is cussed noncents, besides bein outrajusly
wicked. Why don't you behave desunt like other folks? Go to work
and earn a honist livin and not stay round here in this lazy, shiftless
way, pizenin the moral atmosphere with your pestifrous idees! You
wimin folks go back to your lawful husbands, if you've got any, and
take orf them skanderlous gownds and trowsis, and dress respectful
like other wimin. You men folks, cut orf them pirattercal wiskers,
burn up them infurnel pamplits, put sum weskuts on, go to work
choppin wood, splittin fence rales, or tillin the sile. I pored 4th. my
indignashun in this way till I got out of breth, when I stopt.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is not "Artemus Ward" talking; it is Charles Farrar
Browne, and it is Browne who rebukes the Shakers, the Spiritualists,
the Committee from the Woman's Rights Association,
and the office-seekers about Lincoln, who gives advice to the
Prince of Wales and Prince Napoleon, who stands by the flag
when the mob destroys his show down among the "Seseshers,"
and who later addresses the draft rioters at Baldwinsville.
Browne was indeed a moral showman. Every page of his work
is free from profanity and vulgarity. He is never cheap, never
tawdry, never unkind to anything save immorality and snobbishness.
His New England ancestry and breeding may be felt in
all he wrote. At heart he was a reformer. He once wrote:
"Humorous writers have always done the most toward helping
virtue on its pilgrimage, and the truth has found more aid
from them than from all the grave polemists and solid writers
that have ever spoken or written."</p>

<p>Beneath his kindly, whimsical exterior there was a spirit that
could be blown into an indignation as fierce even as Mark Twain's.
While he was local editor of the <i>Plain-Dealer</i> he burst out one
day in this fiery editorial:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A writer in the Philadelphia <i>Ledger</i> has discovered that Edgar A.
Poe was not a man of genius. We take it for granted that the writer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
has never read Poe. His lot in life was hard enough, God knows, and
it is a pity the oyster-house critics, snobs, flunkeys, and literary nincompoops
can't stop snarling over his grave. The biography of Poe by
Griswold&mdash;which production for fiendish malignity is probably unequaled
in the history of letters&mdash;should, it would seem, have sufficed.
No stone marks the spot where poor Poe sleeps, and no friendly hand
strews flowers upon his grave in summer-time, but countless thousands,
all over the world, will read and admire his wildly beautiful pages until
the end of <span class="locked">time.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>This knightly spirit led him to warfare upon everything that
was merely sentimental or insincere. He burlesqued the gushing
love songs of the period, advertising in his program to render
at appropriate intervals "Dearest, Whenest Thou Slumberest
Dostest Thou Dreamest of Me?" and "Dear Mother, I've Come
Home to Die by Request." He burlesqued the sensational novels
of the day in <i>Roberto, the Rover</i>, and <i>Moses, the Sassy</i>. Only
once did he ever read the <i>Ledger</i>, he avers, and that was after
his first experience with New England rum:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>On takin the secund glass I was seezed with a desire to break winders,
&amp; arter imbibin the third glass I knockt a small boy down, pickt his
pocket of a New York <i>Ledger</i>, and wildly commenced readin Sylvanus
Kobb's last Tail.</p></blockquote>

<p>He is still read and still republished. There is a perennial
charm about his work that raises it above the times that produced
it, and that promises to make it permanent. His originality, his
unfailing animal spirits which came of the abounding life of the
new America, his quaint characterization which has added a new
figure to the gallery of fiction, his Americanism, his vein of kindliness
and pathos that underlies all that he wrote, his indignation
at snobbery and all in the life of his day that was not genuine
and pure, and finally the exquisite pathos of his later years, all
combine to make him remembered.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Among the literary progeny of "Artemus Ward" the most
noteworthy, perhaps, was "Petroleum V. Nasby," who became so
familiar a figure during the war. The creator of this unique
character was David Ross Locke, a native of the State of New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
York, and, like Browne, a wandering printer from early boyhood.
When the "Artemus Ward" letters began to appear in the Cleveland
<i>Plain-Dealer</i>, Locke was editor of the Bucyrus <i>Journal</i>, a
few miles to the westward. Their success spurred him to imitation,
but it was not until the firing upon Fort Sumter that he
succeeded at all in attracting attention. Wingert's Corners, a
small hamlet in Crawford County, Ohio, had petitioned the legislature
to remove all negroes from the State. There was a humorous
element in such a proposition from such a source. Why not
give the bellicose little community an appropriate spokesman, a
sort of "copperhead" "Artemus Ward," and have him declare
it totally free and independent of the State? The result was a
letter in the Findlay <i>Jeffersonian</i>, of which Locke was then the
editor, dated "Wingert's Corners, March the 21, 1861," and
signed "Petroleum V. Nasby." The "Nasby Letters" had
begun. The little Ohio hamlet soon proved too small a field for
the redoubtable Democrat, and to give free play to his love of
slavery and untaxed whisky, his hatred of "niggers" and his
self-seeking disloyalty, he was removed to "Confedrit X Roads
(wich is in the Stait of Kentucky)," from which imaginary
center letters continued to flow during the war and the reconstruction
era that followed.</p>

<p>No humorist ever struck a more popular chord. The letters
were republished week by week by the entire Northern press, and
they were looked for by the reading public as eagerly as if they
were reports of battles. The soldiers in the Federal armies read
them with gusto, and Lincoln and Chase considered them a real
source of strength to the Union cause.</p>

<p>Like most political satires, however, the letters do not wear
well. They were too much colored by their times. To-day the
atmosphere of prejudice in which they were written has vanished,
and the most telling hits and timely jokes raise no smile. A generation
has arisen which must have foot-notes if it is to read the
letters. We wonder now what it was that could have so captivated
the first readers.</p>

<p>"Nasby" has little of "Artemus Ward's" whimsical drollery;
indeed, the old Democrat resembles the showman, his prototype,
only in his rusticity, his ignorance of culture, and his defiance of
the laws of spelling. One is Launcelot Gobbo, the other is
Touchstone; one is a mere clown, the other a true humorist, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
genuine as life itself is genuine. It is the duty of the clown to
be a buffoon, to imitate and to come to grief. He essays all the
parts of the acrobats only to roll ignominiously in the dust. Then
to the amazement of the beholders he makes a leap that surpasses
them all. "Nasby" at one time or another enters every sphere
of the political life of his day and generally with small glory to
himself. Through "influence" he becomes postmaster of "Confedrit
X Roads," and through "influence" he loses his position.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The die is cast! The guilloteen hez fallen! I am no longer postmaster
at Confedrit X Roads, wich is in the stait uv Kentucky. The
place that knowd me wunst will know me no more forever; the paper
wich Deekin Pogram takes will be handed out by a nigger; a nigger
will hev the openin uv letters addressed to parties residin hereabouts
containin remittances; a nigger will have the riflin uv letters adrest to
lottery managers and extractin the sweets therfrom; a nigger will be&mdash;but
I couldn't dwell upon the disgustin theme no longer.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is mere clownishness, and yet no type of humor could have
been more acceptable to the time that read it. The Revolutionary
War had had its "McFingal," who loudly preached Toryism
and as a reward was beaten about and even tarred and feathered.
Periods of strife and prejudice always demand a clown,
one who concentrates in a single personality the evils of the time.
"Nasby" stands for blatant copperheadism, just as "McFingal"
stands for Toryism, and as a result he delighted the multitude.
His schemes and ideas and adventures were all exaggerated, and
the persons he dealt with, like President Johnson and his circle,
were heightened to the point of caricature. Magnified fifty diameters,
the evil or the evil personage, like all things seen under
the magnifying glass, becomes grotesque and startling. The people
at first laugh and then they cry out, "Away with this thing;
it is unendurable."</p>

<p>Refinement is not to be expected in political satires that came
hot from a period of prejudice and war, but the coarseness of the
"Nasby" letters goes beyond the bounds of toleration even in
such writings. They smack of the coarseness of the armies of
the period. They reek with whisky until one can almost smell
it as one turns the pages. The uncouth spelling simply adds to
the coarseness; it adds nothing to the reality of the characterization.
There is an impression constantly that the writer is straining
for comic effect. He who is capable of such diction as,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
"They can swear to each other's loyalty, which will reduce the
cost of evidence to a mere nominal sum," would hardly be guilty
of such spellings as "yeelded," "pekoolyer," and "vayloo," the
last standing for "value."</p>

<p>The effect of the letters in forming sentiment in the North at
critical periods was doubtless considerable, but such statements
as the much-quoted one of George S. Boutwell at Cooper Union
that the fall of the Confederacy was due to "three forces&mdash;the
army, the navy, and the Nasby letters"&mdash;must be taken with caution
as too much colored by the enthusiastic atmosphere in which
it was spoken. Their enormous vogue, however, no one can
question. East and West became one as they perused the remorseless
logic of these patriotic satires. Strange as it may seem
to-day, great numbers of the earlier readers had not a suspicion
that "Nasby" of "Confedrit X Roads" was not as real a person
even as "Jeff" Davis. According to Major Pond, "one meeting
of the 'faithful' framed a resolution commending the fidelity to
Democratic principles shown in the Nasby letters, but urging
Mr. Nasby, for the sake of policy, not to be so <span class="locked">outspoken."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></span> In
the presence of such testimony criticism must be silent. Realism
can have no greater triumph than that.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Periods of prejudice and passion tend always to develop satirists.
The Civil War produced a whole school of them. There
was "Bill Arp," the "Nasby" of the South, philosopher and
optimist, who did so much to relieve Southern gloom during the
reconstruction era; there was "Orpheus C. Kerr," who made
ludicrous the office-seeking mania of the times; and, greatest of
them all, including even "Nasby," there was Thomas Nast, who
worked not with pen but with pencil.</p>

<p>No sketch of American humor can ignore Nast. His art was
constructive and compelling. It led the public; it created a new
humorous atmosphere, one distinctively original and distinctively
American. Nast was the father of American caricature. It was
he who first made effective the topical cartoon for a leader; who
first portrayed an individual by some single trait or peculiarity
of apparel; and who first made use of symbolic animals in caricature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
as the Tammany tiger, the Democratic jackass, and the
Republican elephant&mdash;all three of them creations of Nast. His
work is peculiarly significant. He created a new reading public.
Even the illiterate could read the cartoons during the war period
and the Tweed ring days, and it was their reading that put an
end to the evils portrayed. General Grant when asked, "Who is
the foremost figure in civil life developed by the Rebellion?"
replied instantly, "I think Thomas Nast. He did as much as
any one man to preserve the Union and bring the war to an
<span class="locked">end."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></span></p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>In all the humorous writings of the period there was a deep
undercurrent of wisdom. Ever since the days of Franklin, the
typical American has been a maker of aphorisms quaintly expressed.
The man who for years has wrestled with Nature on
frontier or farm has evolved a philosophy of his own. American
life has tended to produce unique individualities: "Sam
Slicks," "Natty Bumppos," "Pudd'nhead Wilsons," "David
Harums," and "Silas Laphams,"&mdash;men rich in self-gained wisdom,
who talk in aphorisms like Lincoln's, "Don't swap horses
when you are crossing a stream."</p>

<p>There has been evolved what may be called the American type
of aphorism&mdash;the concentrated bit of wisdom, old it may be, but
expressed in such a quaint and striking way as to bring surprise
and laughter. The humor may come from the homeliness of the
expression, or the unusual nature of the compared terms, or the
ludicrous image brought suddenly to the mind. Examples are
easily found: "Flattery is like kolone water, tew be smelt of,
but not swallowed"; "It is better to be a young June bug than
an old bird of paradise"; "The man who blows his own trumpet
generally plays a solo"; and "A reasonable amount of fleas is
good fer a dog&mdash;keeps him from broodin' over bein' a dog."</p>

<p>The leader of the latter-day proverbialists was Henry Wheeler
Shaw, a native of Massachusetts, a student for a time at Hamilton
College, and then for twenty years a deckhand, farmer, and
auctioneer in Ohio. He was forty before he began to write.
His "Essay on the Mule," 1859, found no favor. Rewritten the
next year in phonetic spelling and submitted to a New York paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
as "A Essa on the Muel, bi Josh Billings," it became quickly
famous. The people of the early seventies wanted local color.
the tang, as it were, of wild fruit,&mdash;life, fresh, genuine, and first-hand.
They gave a languid approval to Holmes's <i>Poet of the
Breakfast Table</i>, but bought enormous editions of <i>Josh Billings'
Farmers' Allmanax</i>. The edition of 1870 sold 90,000 copies in
three months; that of 1871 sold no fewer than 127,000.</p>

<p>The humor of "Josh Billings" is confined to his aphorisms.
In his longer writings and indeed in his lectures, as we read
them to-day, he is flat and insufferable. He has little of the
high spirits and zest and lightness of "Ph&oelig;nix" and "Ward":
he began his humorous work too late in life for such effects; but
he surpasses them all in seriousness and moral poise. That the
times demanded misspelling and clownishness is to be deplored,
for Shaw was a philosopher, broad and sane; how broad and sane
one can see best in <i>Uncle Esek's Wisdom</i>, a column contributed
for years to the <i>Century Magazine</i>, and, at the request of J.&nbsp;G.
Holland, printed in ordinary spelling.</p>

<p>"With me everything must be put in two or three lines," he
once declared, but his two or three lines are always as compressed
as if written by Emerson. He deals for the most part
with the moral side of life with a common sense as sane as Franklin's.
So wide was the field of his work that one may find quotations
from him on nearly every question that is concerned with
conduct. His stamp is on all he wrote. One may quote from
him at random and be sure of wisdom:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The best cure for rheumatism is to thank the Lord it ain't the gout.</p>

<p>Building air castles is a harmless business as long as you don't attempt
to live in them.</p>

<p>Politeness haz won more viktorys than logick ever haz.</p>

<p>Jealousy is simply another name for self-love.</p>

<p>Faith was given to man to lengthen out his reason.</p>

<p>What the moral army needs just now is more rank and file and fewer
brigadier generals.</p></blockquote>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>The great tide of comic writings became fast and furious in
the seventies. In 1872 no fewer than nine comic papers were
established in New York alone: <i>The Brickbat</i>, <i>The Cartoon</i>,
<i>Frank Leslie's Budget of Fun</i>, <i>The Jolly Joker</i>, <i>Nick-nax</i>, <i>Merryman's
Monthly</i>, <i>The Moon</i>, <i>The Phunny Fellow</i>, <i>The Thistle</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
and perhaps others. Some died after the first issue, some persisted
longer. Every year saw its own crop of comics rise,
flourish and die. In 1877 <i>Puck</i> was established, the first really
successful comic paper in America; in 1881 appeared <i>Judge</i>;
and in 1883 <i>Life</i>, the first to succeed without politics.</p>

<p>Very little of all this humorous product can be called literature;
the greater part of it already has passed into oblivion;
yet for all that the movement that produced it cannot be neglected
by one who would study the period. The outburst of humor
in the sixties and the seventies was indeed significant.
Poor though the product may have been, it was American in
background and spirit, and it was drawn from no models save
life itself. For the first time America had a national literature
in the broad sense of the word, original and colored by its own
soil. The work of every one in the school was grounded in
sincerity. The worker saw with his own eyes and he looked
only for truth. He attacked sentimentality and gush and all
that was affected and insincere. Born of the great moral awakening
of the war, the humor had in it the Cervantes spirit.
Nast, for instance, in his later years declared, "I have never
allowed myself to attack anything I did not believe in my soul
to be wrong and deserving of the worst fate that could befall
it." The words are significant. The laughter of the period
was not the mere crackling of thorns under a pot, not a mere
fusillade of quips and puns; there was depth in it and purpose.
It swept away weakness and wrongs. It purged America and
brought sanity and health of soul. From the work of the humorists
followed the second accomplishment of the period: those
careful studies in prose and verse of real life in the various
sections of America.</p>

<span class="subhead">MARK TWAIN</span></h2>

<p>With Mark Twain, American literature became for the first
time really national. He was the first man of letters of any
distinction to be born west of the Mississippi. He spent his
boyhood and young manhood near the heart of the continent,
along the great river during the vital era when it was the boundary
line between known and unknown America, and when it
resounded from end to end with the shouts and the confusion of
the first great migration from the East; he lived for six thrilling
years in the camps and the boom towns and the excited cities of
Nevada and California; and then, at thirty-one, a raw product
of the raw West, he turned his face to the Atlantic Coast, married
a rare soul from one of the refined families of New York
State, and settled down to a literary career in New England,
with books and culture and trips abroad, until in his old age
Oxford University could confer upon him&mdash;"Tom Sawyer,"
whose schooling in the ragged river town had ended before he
was twelve&mdash;the degree that had come to America only as borne
by two or three of the Brahmins of New England. Only
America, and America at a certain period, could produce a
paradox like that.</p>

<p>Mark Twain interpreted the West from the standpoint of a
native. The group of humorists who had first brought to the
East the Western spirit and the new laughter had all of them
been reared in the older sections. John Ph&oelig;nix and Artemus
Ward and Josh Billings were born in New England, and Nasby
and many of the others were natives of New York State. All
of them in late boyhood had gone West as to a wonderland and
had breathed the new atmosphere as something strange and exhilarating,
but Mark Twain was native born. He was himself a
part of the West; he removed from it so as to see it in true perspective,
and so became its best interpreter. Hawthorne had once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
expressed a wish to see some part of America "where the damned
shadow of Europe has never fallen." Mark Twain spent his
life until he was thirty in such unshadowed places. When he
wrote he wrote without a thought of other writings; it was as if
the West itself was dictating its autobiography.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>The father of Mark Twain, John Clemens, a dreamer and an
idealist, had left Virginia with his young wife early in the
twenties to join the restless tide that even then was setting
strongly westward. Their first settlement was at Gainsborough,
Tennessee, where was born their first son, Orion, but they remained
there not long. Indeed, like all emigrants of their type,
they remained nowhere long. During the next ten or eleven
years five other children were born to them at four different
stations along the line of their westward progress. When the
fifth child arrived, to be christened Samuel Langhorne, they were
living at Florida, Missouri, a squalid little hamlet fifty miles
west of the Mississippi. That was November 30, 1835. Four
years later they made what proved to be their last move, settling
at Hannibal, Missouri, a small river town about a hundred
miles above St. Louis. Here it was that the future Mark Twain
spent the next fourteen years, those formative years between
four and eighteen that determine so greatly the bent of the
later life.</p>

<p>The Hannibal of the forties and the fifties was hardly a town
one would pick deliberately for the education of a great man
of letters. It lay just a few miles above the northern line of
Pike County&mdash;that Pike County, Missouri, that gave name to
the shiftless, hand-to-mouth, ague-shaken type of humanity later
to be celebrated so widely as the Pike. Hannibal was not
a Pike community, but it was typically southwestern in its somnolent,
slave-holding, care-free atmosphere. The one thing that
forever rescued it from the commonplace was the River, the
tremendous Mississippi, source of endless dreams and romance.
Mark Twain has given us a picture, perfect as an etching, of this
river and the little town that nestled beside it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>After all these years I can picture that old time to myself now, just
as it was then: the white town drowsing in the sunshine of a summer's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
morning; the streets empty, or pretty nearly so; one or two clerks
sitting in front of the Water Street stores, with their splint-bottomed
chairs tilted back against the wall, chins on breast, hats slouched over
their faces, asleep&mdash;with shingle shavings enough around to show what
broke them down; a sow and a litter of pigs loafing along the sidewalk,
doing a good business in water-melon rinds and seeds; two or
three lonely little freight piles scattered around the "levee"; a pile of
"skids" on the slope of the stone-paved wharf, and the fragrant town
drunkard asleep in the shadow of them; two or three wood flats at the
head of the wharf, but nobody to listen to the peaceful lapping of the
wavelets against them; the great Mississippi, the majestic, the magnificent
Mississippi, rolling its mile-wide tide along, shining in the sun;
the dense forest away on the other side; the "point" above the town,
and the "point" below, bounding the river glimpse and turning it into
a sort of sea, and withal a very still and brilliant and lonely one.
Presently a film of dark smoke appears above one of these remote
"points"; instantly a negro drayman, famous for his quick eye and
prodigious voice, lifts up the cry, "S-t-e-a-m boat a-comin'!" and the
scene changes! The town drunkard stirs, the clerks wake up, a furious
clatter of drays follows, every house and store pours out a human
contribution, and all in a twinkling the dead town is alive and moving.
Drays, carts, men, boys, all go hurrying to a common center, the wharf.
Assembled there, the people fasten their eyes upon the coming boat as
upon a wonder they are seeing for the first time.... The furnace
doors are open and the fires glaring bravely; the upper decks are black
with passengers; the captain stands by the big bell, calm, imposing,
the envy of all; great volumes of the blackest smoke are rolling and
tumbling out of the chimneys&mdash;a husbanded grandeur created with a
bit of pitch pine just before arriving at a town; the crew are grouped
on the forecastle; the broad stage is run far out over the port bow,
and an envied deck-hand stands picturesquely on the end of it with a
coil of rope in his hand; the pent steam is screaming through the gage-cocks;
the captain lifts his hand, a bell rings, the wheels stop; then
they turn back, churning the water to foam, and the steamer is at rest.
Then such a scramble as there is to get aboard, and to get ashore, and
to take in freight, and to discharge freight, all at one and the same time;
and such a yelling and cursing as the mates facilitate it all with! Ten
minutes later the steamer is under way again, with no flag on the jack-staff
and no black smoke issuing from the chimneys. After ten more
minutes the town is dead again, and the town drunkard asleep by the
skids once <span class="locked">more.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>It was the romance of this river, the vastness and the mystery
of it, the great unknown world which lay beyond those
"points" where all things disappeared, that made of the boy a
restless soul, a dreamer and an idealist&mdash;that made of him indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
the Mark Twain of the later years. His books nowhere
rise into the pure serene of literature unless touched at some
point by this magic stream that flowed so marvelously through
his boyhood. The two discoverers of the Mississippi were De
Soto and Mark Twain.</p>

<p>The first crisis in the boy's life came in his twelfth year, when
the death of his father sent him as an apprentice to a country
newspaper office, that most practical and most exacting of all
training schools for youth. Two years on the Missouri <i>Courier</i>,
four years on the Hannibal <i>Journal</i>, then the restlessness of his
clan sent him wandering into the East even as it had sent Artemus
Ward and Nasby into the West. For fifteen months he
served as compositor in New York City and Philadelphia, then
a great homesickness for the river came upon him. From boyhood
it had been his dream to be the pilot of a Mississippi steamboat;
all other professions seemed flat and lifeless compared
with that satisfying and boundless field of action; and it is not
strange that in April, 1857, we find him installed as Horace
Bixby's "cub" at the beginning of a new career.</p>

<p>During the next four years he gave himself heart and soul to
the almost superhuman task of committing to memory every
sandbar and point and landmark in twelve hundred miles of a
shifting, treacherous river. The difficulties he has explained
fully in his book. It was a college course of four years, and
no man ever had a better one. To quote his own words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In that brief, sharp schooling I got personally and familiarly acquainted
with all the different types of human nature that are to be
found in fiction, biography, or history. When I find a well-drawn
character in fiction or biography, I generally take a warm personal
interest in him, for the reason that I have known him before&mdash;met him
on the <span class="locked">river.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>It taught him far more than this. The pilot of a great Mississippi
boat was a man with peculiar responsibilities. The lives
of the passengers and the safety of the cargo were absolutely
in his hands. His authority was above even the captain's. Only
picked men of courage and judgment with a self-reliance that
never wavered in any crisis were fit material for pilots. To
quote Horace Bixby, the most noted of them all:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>There were no signal lights along the shore in those days, and no
searchlights on the vessels; everything was blind, and on a dark, misty
night in a river full of snags and shifting sand-bars and changing
shores, a pilot's judgment had to be founded on <i>absolute certainty</i>.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Under such conditions men were valued only for what they
actually could do. There was no entrance into the inner circle
of masters of the river save through genuineness and real efficiency.
Sentimentalizing and boasting and sham died instantly
in that stern atmosphere. To live for four years in daily contact
with such men taught one coarseness of speech and an appalling
fluency in the use of profanity, but it taught one at the
same time to look with supreme contempt upon inefficiency and
pretense.</p>

<p>The "cub" became at length a pilot, to be entrusted after a
time with some of the finest boats on the river. He became
very efficient in his hard-learned profession so conspicuously
so that he won the commendation even of Bixby, who could say
in later years, "Sam Clemens never had an accident either as
a steersman or as a pilot, except once when he got aground for
a few hours in the <i>bagasse</i> (cane) smoke, with no damage to any
<span class="locked">one."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></span> But the war put a sudden end to the piloting. The
river was closed, and in April, 1861, he went reluctantly back
to Hannibal. "I loved the profession far better than any I
have ever followed since," he declared in his later years, "and
I took a measureless pride in it." It is very possible that but
for the war and the change which it wrought upon the river,
Mark Twain might have passed his whole life as a Mississippi
pilot.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>After a few weeks in a self-recruited troop that fell to pieces
before it could join the Confederate army, the late pilot, now
twenty-six years old, started by stage coach across the Plains
with his brother Orion, who had just been appointed secretary
to the new Governor of Nevada. It was Mark Twain's entry
upon what, in college terms, may be called his graduate course.
It was six years long and it covered one of the most picturesque
eras in the history of Western America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
For a few restive months he remained at Carson City as his
brother's assistant, then in characteristic fashion he broke away
to join the excited tide of gold seekers that was surging through
all the mountains of Nevada. During the next year he lived in
mining camps with prospectors and eager claim-holders. Luck,
however, seemed against him; at least it promised him little as
a miner, and when the Virginia City <i>Enterprise</i>, to which he
had contributed letters, offered him a position on its staff of
reporters, he jumped at the opportunity.</p>

<p>Now for two years he lived at the very heart of the mining
regions of the West, in Virginia City, the home of the Comstock
lode, then at its highest boom. Everything about him&mdash;the newness
and rawness of things, the peculiar social conditions, the
atmosphere of recklessness and excitement, the money that
flowed everywhere in fabulous quantities&mdash;everything was
unique. Even the situation of the city was remarkable. Hingston,
who visited it with Artemus Ward while Mark Twain was
still a member of the <i>Enterprise</i> staff, speaks of it as "perched
up on the side of Mt. Davidson some five or six thousand feet
above sea level, with a magnificent view before us of the desert.... Nothing
but arid rocks and sandy plains sprinkled with
sage brush. No village for full two hundred miles, and any
number of the worst type of Indians&mdash;the Goshoots&mdash;agreeably
besprinkling the <span class="locked">path."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></span> Artemus Ward estimated its population
at twelve thousand. He was impressed by its wildness, "its
splendid streets paved with silver ore," "its unadulterated cussedness,"
its vigilance committee "which hangs the more vicious
of the pestiferous crowd," and its fabulous output of silver
which is "melted down into bricks the size of common house
bricks, then loaded into huge wagons, each drawn by eight and
twelve mules, and sent off to San <span class="locked">Francisco."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>It was indeed a strange area of life that passed before the
young Mississippi pilot. For two winters he was sent down
to report the new legislature of the just-organized territory,
and it was while engaged in this picturesque gala task that
he sent back his letters signed for the first time Mark Twain.
That was the winter of 1863. It was time now for him to seek
a wider field. Accordingly, the following May he went down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
to San Francisco, where at length he found employment on the
<i>Morning Call</i>.</p>

<p>Now for the first time the young reporter found himself in
a literary atmosphere. Poets and sketch-writers and humorists
were everywhere. There was at least one flourishing literary
journal, the <i>Golden Era</i>, and its luxuriously appointed office
was the literary center of the Pacific Coast. "Joaquin Miller
recalls from an old diary, kept by him then, having seen Adah
Isaacs Menken, Prentice Mulford, Bret Harte, Charles Warren
Stoddard, Fitzhugh Ludlow, Mark Twain, Orpheus C. Kerr,
Artemus Ward, Gilbert Densmore, W.&nbsp;S. Kendall, and Mrs.
Hitchcock assembled there at one <span class="locked">time."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></span> Charles Henry Webb
was just starting a literary weekly, the <i>Californian</i>, and when,
a year later, Bret Harte was made its editor, Mark Twain was
added to the contributing staff. It was the real beginning of
his literary career. He received now helpful criticism. In a
letter written in after years to Thomas Bailey Aldrich he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Bret Harte trimmed and trained and schooled me patiently until he
changed me from an awkward utterer of coarse grotesqueness to a
writer of paragraphs and chapters that have found a certain favor in
the eyes of even some of the very decentest people in the <span class="locked">land.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>To the <i>Californian</i> and the <i>Era</i> he now contributed that series
of sketches which later was drawn upon for material for his first
published book. But the old restlessness was upon him again.
He struck out into the Tuolumne Hills with Jim Gillis as a
pocket miner and for months lived as he could in shacks and
camps, panning between drenching showers worthless gravel,
expecting every moment to find gold. He found no gold, but
he found what was infinitely richer. In later years in a letter
to Gillis he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It makes my heart ache yet to call to mind some of those days. Still
it shouldn't, for right in the depths of their poverty and their pocket-hunting
vagabondage lay the germ of my coming good fortune. You
remember the one gleam of jollity that shot across our dismal sojourn in
the rain and mud of Angel's Camp&mdash;I mean that day we sat around
the tavern and heard that chap tell about the frog and how they filled
him with shot. And you remember how we quoted from the yarn and
laughed over it out there on the hillside while you and dear old Stoker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
panned and washed. I jotted the story down in my note-book that day,
and would have been glad to get ten or fifteen dollars for it&mdash;I was just
that blind. But then we were so hard up. I published that story, and
it became widely known in America, India, China, England, and the
reputation it made for me has paid me thousands and thousands of
dollars <span class="locked">since.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>The publication in New York, May 1, 1867, of <i>The Celebrated
Jumping Frog of Calaveras County and Other Sketches</i> and
the delivery a week later by the author of <i>The Jumping Frog</i>
of a lecture on the Sandwich Islands marks the end of the
period of preparation in Mark Twain's life. A new American
author had arrived.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Send this Mississippi pilot, printer, adventurer, miner in rough
camps of the Sierras, to Paris, Italy, Constantinople, and the
Holy Land, and what will be his impressions? For an answer
we must read <i>The Innocents Abroad</i>. It will be no <i>Outre Mer</i>,
we are certain of that, and no <i>Pencillings by the Way</i>. Before
a line of it was written an atmosphere had been created unique
in American literature, for where, save in the California of
1867, was there ever optimism, nay, romanticism, that could
reply instantly to the young reporter who asked to be sent on a
Don Quixote pilgrimage to Europe and the Orient, "Go. Twelve
hundred and fifty dollars will be paid for you before the vessel
sails, and your only instructions are that you will continue to
write at such times and from such places as you deem proper, and
in the same style that heretofore secured you the favor of the
readers of the <i>Alta California</i>"?</p>

<p>It was not to be a tour of Europe, as Longfellow and Willis
and Taylor had made it, the pilgrimage of a devotee to holy
shrines; it was to be a great picnic with sixty-seven in the picnic
party. Moreover, the recorder of it was bound by his instructions
to report it in the style that had won him California fame.
It was to be a Western book, written by a Westerner from the
Western standpoint, but this does not imply that his Western
readers expected an illiterate production full of coarseness and
rude wit. California had produced a school of poets and romancers;
she had serious literary journals, and she was proud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
of them. The letters, if California was to set her stamp of approval
upon them, must have literary charm; they must have,
moreover, freshness and originality; and they must sparkle with
that spirit of humor which already had begun to be recognized
as a native product.</p>

<p>We open the book and linger a moment over the preface:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Notwithstanding it is only the record of a picnic, it has a purpose,
which is, to suggest to the reader how <i>he</i> would be likely to see Europe
and the East if he looked at them with his own eyes instead of the eyes
of those who traveled in those countries before him. I make small
pretence of showing any one how he <i>ought</i> to look at objects of interest
beyond the sea&mdash;other books do that, and therefore, even if I were
competent to do it, there is no need.</p>

<p>I offer no apologies for any departures from the usual style of travel-writing
that may be charged against me&mdash;for I think I have seen with
impartial eyes, and I am sure I have written at least honestly, whether
wisely or not.</p></blockquote>

<p>Let us read the book straight through. We are impressed
with the fact that, despite the supposition of its first readers, it
is not primarily a humorous work. It is a genuine book of
travels. It is first of all an honest record, even as its author
averred. In the second place it is the book of a young man, a
young man on a lark and full of the highest spirits. The world
is good&mdash;it is a good show, though it is full of absurdities and
of humbugs that should be exposed. The old stock jokes of
the grand tour&mdash;the lack of soap, the charge for candles, the
meeting of supposed foreigners who break unexpectedly into the
best of English, and all the well-known others&mdash;were new to the
public then and they came with freshness. Then it is the book
of one who saw, even as he claimed, with his own eyes. This
genuine American, with his training on the river and the wild
frontier where men and things are what they <i>are</i>, no more and
no less, will be impressed only with genuineness. He will describe
things precisely as he sees them. Gibraltar "is pushed
out into the sea on the end of a flat, narrow strip of land, and
is suggestive of a 'gob' of mud on the end of a shingle"; of the
Coliseum: "everybody recognizes at once that 'looped and windowed'
bandbox with a side bitten out"; and of a famous river:
"It is popular to admire the Arno. It is a great historical creek
with four feet in the channel and some scows floating around. It
would be a very passable river if they would pump some water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
into it." That was not written for a joke: it was the way the
Arno honestly impressed the former Mississippi pilot.</p>

<p>He is not always critical. Genuineness and real worth never
fail to impress him. Often he stands before a landscape, a city,
a cathedral, as enthusiastic as any of the older school of travelers.
The book is full of vivid descriptions, some of them almost
poetic in their spirit and diction. But things must be what they
pretend to be, or they will disgust him. Everywhere there is
scorn for the mere echoer of the enthusiasm of others. He will
not gush over an unworthy thing even if he knows the whole
world has gushed over it. Da Vinci's "Last Supper," painted
on a dilapidated wall and stained and scarred and dimmed, may
once have been beautiful, he admits, but it is not so now. The
pilgrims who stand before it "able to speak only in catchy ejaculations
of rapture" fill him with wrath. "How can they see
what is not visible?" The work of the old masters fills him
always with indignation. They painted not Hebrews in their
scriptural pieces, but Italians. "Their nauseous adulation of
princely patrons was more prominent to me and claimed my
attention more than the charms of color." "Raphael pictured
such infernal villains as Catherine and Marie de Medicis seated
in heaven conversing familiarly with the Virgin Mary and the
angels (to say nothing of higher personages), and yet my friends
abuse me because I am a little prejudiced against the old masters."</p>

<p>Here we have a note that was to become more and more emphatic
in Mark Twain's work with every year he lived: his indignation
at oppression and insincerity. The cathedrals of Italy
lost their beauty for him when he saw the misery of the population.
He stood before the Grand Duomo of Florence. "Like
all other men I fell down and worshiped it, but when the filthy
beggars swarmed around me the contrast was too striking, too
suggestive, and I said 'O sons of classic Italy, <i>is</i> the spirit of
enterprise, of self-reliance, of noble endeavor, utterly dead
within ye? Curse your indolent worthlessness, why don't you
rob your church?' Three hundred happy, comfortable priests
are employed in that cathedral."</p>

<p>Everywhere he strikes out at sentimentality. When he learns
how Abelard deliberately sacrificed Héloïse to his own selfish
ideals, he bursts out: "The tons of sentiment I have wasted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
on that unprincipled humbug in my ignorance! I shall throttle
down my emotions hereafter, about this sort of people, until
I have read them up and know whether they are entitled to
any tearful attentions or not." He is eager to see a French
"grissette," but having seen one, bursts out in true Artemus
Ward fashion: "Aroint thee, wench! I sorrow for the vagabond
student of the Latin Quarter now, even more than formerly I envied
him. Thus topples to the earth another idol of my infancy."
The story of Petrarch's love for Laura only fills him
with pity for the outrageously treated "Mr. Laura," the unknown
husband of the heroine, who bore the burden but got
none of the glory, and when they tell the thrilling legend of the
old medieval castle, he makes only the comment, "Splendid
legend&mdash;splendid lie&mdash;drive on!"</p>

<p>It was a blow at the whole school of American travel writers;
it marked the passing of an era. Bret Harte in the first volume
of the <i>Overland Monthly</i> (1868), was the first to outline the
Western standpoint:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The days of sentimental journeyings are over. The dear old book
of travel ... is a thing of the past. Sentimental musings on foreign
scenes are just now restricted to the private diaries of young and impressible
ladies and clergymen with affections of the bronchial tubes.... A
race of good humored, engaging iconoclasts seem to have precipitated
themselves upon the old altars of mankind, and like their
predecessors of the eighth century, have paid particular attention to the
holy church. Mr. Howells has slashed one or two sacred pictorial canvases
with his polished rapier; Mr. Swift has made one or two neat
long shots with a rifled Parrott, and Mr. Mark Twain has used brickbats
on stained glass windows with damaging effect. And those gentlemen
have certainly brought down a heap of <span class="locked">rubbish.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>It was the voice of the new West and of the new era. With
<i>The Innocents Abroad</i> begins the new period in American literature.
The book is full of the new after-the-war Americanism
that did its own thinking, that saw with its own eyes, that put
a halo upon nothing save genuineness and substantial worth.
It must not be forgotten that America even in the new seventies
was still mawkish with sentimentality. The very year <i>The
Innocents Abroad</i> appeared, <i>Gates Ajar</i> sold twenty editions.
Mark Twain came into the age like the Goths into Rome. Stand
on the solid earth, he cried. Look with your own eyes. Worship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
nothing but truth and genuineness. Europe is no better
than America. Como is beautiful, but it is not so beautiful as
Tahoe. Why this eternal glorification of things simply and
solely because it is the conventional thing to glorify them?
"The critic," he wrote in later years to Andrew Lang, "has
actually imposed upon the world the superstition that a painting
by Raphael is more valuable to the civilizations of the earth
than is a chromo; and the august opera more than the hurdy
gurdy and the villagers' singing society; and the Latin classics
than Kipling's far-reaching bugle note; and Jonathan Edwards
than the Salvation <span class="locked">Army."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></span> The new American democracy
was speaking. To the man who for four years had learned in
the school of Horace Bixby there was no high and no low save
as measured, not by appearances or by tradition, but by intrinsic
worth.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>It has been customary in libraries to place the earlier works of
Mark Twain on the same shelf as those of Artemus Ward and
Josh Billings. To the thousands who laughed at him as he
lectured from year to year he was a mere maker of fun. The
public that bought such enormous editions of <i>The Innocents
Abroad</i> and <i>Roughing It</i> bought them as books to laugh over.
What shall we say to-day of Mark Twain's humor? A generation
has arisen to whom he is but a tradition and a set of books;
what is the verdict of this generation?</p>

<p>First of all, it is necessary that we examine the man himself.
Nature seems to have forced him into the ranks of the comedians.
From his mother he inherited a drawl that was inexpressibly
funny; he had a laughable personality, and a laughable
angle from which he looked at life. He could no more help
provoking mirth than he could help being himself. Moreover,
he had been thrown during his formative years into a veritable
training school for humorists. On the river and in the mines
and the raw towns and cities of the West, he had lived in a gale
of high spirits, of loud laughter, of practical jokes, and droll
stories that had gone the rough round of the boats or the camps.
His humor, therefore, was an echo of the laughter of elemental
men who have been flung into conditions full of incongruities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
and strange contrasts. It is the humor of exaggeration run
wild, of youthful high spirits, of rough practical jokes, of understatement,
of irreverence, and gross absurdity.</p>

<p>But the personality of Mark Twain no longer can give life
to his humor; the atmosphere in which it first appeared has gone
forever; the man himself is becoming a mere legend, shadowy
and more and more distorted; his humor must be judged now
like that of Cervantes and Shakespeare, apart from author and
times. How does it stand the test? Not at all well. There are
the high spirits of the new West in it&mdash;that element has not evaporated&mdash;and
there is in it a personal touch, a drollery that was
his individual contribution to humor. There was a certain drawl
in his pen as well as in his tongue. It is this alone that saves
much of his humorous work from flatness. Concerning <i>The
Jumping Frog</i>, for instance, Haweis asks in true British way,
"What, I should like to know, is the fun of saying that a frog
who has been caused to swallow a quantity of shot cannot jump
so high as he could before?" The answer is that there is no fun
save in the way the story is told; in other words, save in the
incomparable drawl of Mark Twain's pen. One can only illustrate:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The feller ... give it back to Smiley, and says, very deliberate,
"Well, I don't see no pints about that frog that's any better'n any
other frog."</p>

<p>"May be you don't," Smiley says. "May be you understand frogs,
and may be you don't understand 'em; may be you've had experience,
and may be you ain't, only a amature, as it were. Any ways I've got
<i>my</i> opinion, and I'll risk forty dollars that he can out-jump any frog in
Calaveras county."</p>

<p>And the feller studied a minute, and then says, kinder sad like,
"Well, I'm only a stranger here, and I ain't got no frog; but if I had
a frog, I'd bet you!"</p></blockquote>

<p>Or take this episode from <i>The Innocents Abroad</i> where he
tells of his sensations one night as a boy upon awakening
and finding the body of a murdered man on the floor of his
room:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I went away from there. I do not say that I went away in any sort
of a hurry, but I simply went&mdash;that is sufficient. I went out at the
window, and I carried the sash along with me. I did not need the sash,
but it was handier to take it than it was to leave it, and so I took it. I
was not scared, but I was considerably agitated.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
All this and the hundreds of pages like it in <i>The Innocents
Abroad</i> and <i>Roughing It</i> and the later books is excellent drollery,
but had Mark Twain written nothing else than this he would be as
dead now as an author as even "Doesticks." His drollery is
best in the work that lies nearest to the source of his first inspiration.
As the Western days faded from his memory, his
comedy became more and more forced, until it could reach at
last the inane flatness of <i>Adam's Diary</i> and flatter still, <i>Eve's
Diary</i>.</p>

<p>The humor that lives, however, is not drollery; it must be
embodied in a humorous character like Falstaff, for instance,
or Don Quixote. The most of Mark Twain's fun comes from exaggerated
situations with no attempt at characterization, and
therein lies his weakness as a humorist. Huckleberry Finn and
Colonel Sellers come the nearest to being humorous creations,
but Huckleberry Finn is but a bit of <i>genre</i>, the eternal bad boy
in a Pike County costume, and Colonel Sellers is but a preliminary
study toward a character, a shadowy figure that we feel
constantly to be on the point of jumping into greatness without
ever actually arriving. Narrowly as he may have missed the
mark in these two characters, Mark Twain cannot be classed
with the great humorists.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>There are three Mark Twains: there is Mark Twain, the droll
comedian, who wrote for the masses and made them laugh; there
is Mark Twain, the indignant protester, who arose ever and
anon to true eloquence in his denunciation of tyranny and pretense;
and there is Mark Twain, the romancer, who in his boyhood
had dreamed by the great river and who later caught the
romance of a period in American life. The masterpiece of the
first is <i>The Jumping Frog</i>, of the second <i>The Man that Corrupted
Hadleyburg</i>, and of the third <i>Life on the Mississippi</i> and
<i>Roughing It</i>.</p>

<p>It is this third Mark Twain that still lives and that will continue
to live in American literature. He saw with distinctness
a unique area of American life. As the brief and picturesque
era faded away he caught the sunset glory of it and embodied
it in romance&mdash;the steamboat days on the river in the slavery
era, the old régime in the South, the barbarism of the Plains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
the great buffalo herds, the wild camps in the gold fields of
Nevada and California. In half a dozen books: <i>Roughing It</i>,
<i>Life on the Mississippi</i>, <i>The Gilded Age</i> (a few chapters of it),
<i>Tom Sawyer</i>, <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>, <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i>, he has
done work that can never be done again. The world that these
books depict has vanished as completely as the Bagdad of Haroun
al Raschid. Not only has he told the story of this vanished
world, illustrating it with descriptions and characterizations that
are like Flemish portraits, but he has caught and held the spirit
of it, and he has thrown over it all the nameless glow of romance.
It is as golden a land that he leads us through as any we may find
in Scott, and yet it was drawn from the life with painstaking
care. Scott and Bulwer and Cooper angered Mark Twain.
They were careless of facts, they were sentimental, they misinterpreted
the spirit of the times they depicted and the men
and women who lived in them, but these six books of Mark Twain
may be placed among the source books of American history. Nowhere
else can one catch so truly certain phases of the spirit of
the mid-nineteenth century West. Over every page of them may
be written those words from the preface of <i>The Innocents
Abroad</i>, "I am sure I have written at least honestly, whether
wisely or not."</p>

<p>The books are six chapters of autobiography. <i>Tom Sawyer</i>
and <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> are recollections of that boyhood by the
river after so long a time had elapsed that the day-dreams and
boyish imaginings were recorded as real happenings; <i>Life on
the Mississippi</i> records that romantic adventure of his young
manhood as he recalled it in later days when the old piloting
era had vanished like a dream of boyhood; <i>The Gilded Age</i>, a book
of glorious fragments, has in it his uncle James Lampton drawn
from life and renamed Colonel Sellers; <i>Roughing It</i> bubbles
over with the joy and the high spirits and the excitement of those
marvelous days when the author and the West were young together;
and <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i> gives the tragedy of slavery
as it passed before his boyish eyes. These books and <i>The Innocents
Abroad</i> are Mark Twain's contribution to the library of
American classics. The rest of his enormously large output,
despite brilliant passages here and there, does not greatly
matter.</p>

<p>They are not artistic books. The author had little skill in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
construction. He excelled in brilliant dashes, not in long-continued
effort. He was his own Colonel Sellers, restless, idealistic,
Quixotic. What he did he did with his whole soul without restraint
or sense of proportion. There is in all he wrote a lack
of refinement, kept at a minimum, to be sure, by his wife, who
for years was his editor and severest critic, but likely at any
moment to crop out. His books, all of them, are monotones, a
running series of episodes and descriptions all of the same value,
never reaching dramatic climax. The episodes themselves, however,
are told with graphic intensity; some of them are gems
well-nigh perfect. Here is a picture of the famous pony express
of the Plains:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The pony-rider was usually a little bit of a man, brimful of spirit
and endurance. No matter what time of the day or night his watch
came on, and no matter whether it was winter or summer, raining,
snowing, hailing, or sleeting, or whether his "beat" was a level straight
road or a crazy trail over mountain crags and precipices, or whether it
led through peaceful regions that swarmed with hostile Indians, he
must be always ready to leap into the saddle and be off like the wind.
He rode fifty miles without stopping, by daylight, moonlight, starlight,
or through the blackness of darkness&mdash;just as it happened. He rode a
splendid horse that was born for a racer and fed and lodged like a
gentleman; kept him at his utmost speed for ten miles, and then, as he
came crashing up to the station where stood two men holding fast a
fresh, impatient steed, the transfer of rider and mailbag was made in
the twinkling of an eye, and away flew the eager pair and were out of
sight before the spectator could hardly get the ghost of a look.</p>

<p>We had had a consuming desire, from the beginning, to see a
pony-rider, but somehow or other all that had passed us and all that met us
managed to streak by in the night, and so we heard only a whiz and a
hail, and the swift phantom of the desert was gone before we could
get our heads out of the windows. But now we were expecting one
along every moment, and we would see him in broad daylight. Presently
the driver exclaims:</p>

<p>"Here he comes!"</p>

<p>Every neck is stretched further, and every eye strained wider. Away
across the endless dead level of the prairie a black speck appears
against the sky, and it is plain that it moves. Well, I should think so!
In a second or two it becomes a horse and rider, rising and falling,
rising and falling&mdash;sweeping toward us nearer and nearer&mdash;growing
more and more distinct, more and more sharply defined&mdash;nearer and
still nearer, and the flutter of the hoofs comes faintly to the ear&mdash;another
instant a whoop and a hurrah from our upper deck, a wave of
the rider's hand, but no reply, and man and horse burst past our excited
faces, and go winging away like a belated fragment of a storm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
The steamboat race and the explosion in chapter four of
<i>The Gilded Age</i> have few equals in any language for mere picturing
power. He deals largely with the out-of-doors. His
canvases are bounded only by the horizon: the Mississippi, the
great Plains, the Rocky Mountains, Mono Lake, the Alkali
Deserts, and the Sierras&mdash;he has handled a continent. Only
Joaquin Miller and John Muir have used canvases as vast.
Huckleberry Finn's floating journey down the river on his raft
has in it something of the spirit of <i>The Odyssey</i> and <i>Pilgrim's
Progress</i> and <i>Don Quixote</i>. Had Mark Twain's constructive
skill and his ability to trace the growth of a human soul been
equal to his picturing power, his Defoe-like command of detail
and situation, and his mastery of phrase and of narrative, he
might have said the last word in American fiction. He was a
product of his section and of his education. College and university
would have made of him an artist like Holmes, brilliant,
refined, and messageless. It would have robbed him of the very
fountain-head of his power. It was his to work not from books
but from life itself, to teach truth and genuineness of life, to
turn the eyes of America from the romance of Europe to her
own romantic past.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>If Artemus Ward is Touchstone, Mark Twain is Lear's Fool.
He was a knightly soul, sensitive and serious, a nineteenth-century
knight errant who would protect the weak of the whole
world and right their wrongs. The genuineness and honesty
that had been ground into his soul on the river and in the mines
where a man was a man only when he could show true manliness,
were a part of his knightly equipment. When financial disaster
came to him, as it had come to Scott, through no fault of his own,
he refused to repudiate the debt as he might have done with no
discredit to himself, and, though old age was upon him, he set
out to earn by his own efforts the whole enormous amount. And
he discharged the debt to the full. He had, moreover, the true
knight's soul of romance. The <i>Morte d'Arthur</i> and the chronicles
of Joan of Arc, his favorite reading, contained the atmosphere
that he loved. He fain would have given his generation
"pure literature," but they bade him back to his cap and bells.
Richardson, as late as 1886, classed him with the purveyors of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
"rude and clownish merriment" and advised him to "make hay
while the sun <span class="locked">shines."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>So he jested and capered while his heart was heavy with personal
sorrows that came thick upon him as the years went by,
and with the baseness and weakness and misery of humanity
as the spectacle passed under his keen observation. Yet in it
all he was true to himself. That sentence in the preface tells
the whole story: "I have written at least honestly." His own
generation bought his books for the fun in them; their children
are finding now that their fathers bought not, as they supposed,
clownish ephemeræ, but true literature, the classics of
the period.</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;strange paradox!&mdash;it was the cap and bells that
made Mark Twain and that hastened the coming of the new
period in American literature. The cap and bells it was that
made him known in every hamlet and in every household of
America, north and south and east and west, and in all lands
across all oceans. Only Cooper and Mrs. Stowe of all our American
authors are known so widely. This popularity it was that
gave wings to the first all-American literature and that inspired
a new school of American writers. After Mark Twain American
literature was no longer confined to Boston and its environs; it
was as wide as the continent itself.</p>

<span class="subhead">BRET HARTE</span></h2>

<p>In his <i>Chronological Outlines of American Literature</i>, Whitcomb
mentions only thirteen American novels published during
the seven years before 1870: Taylor's <i>Hannah Thurston</i>, <i>John
Godfrey's Fortunes</i>, and <i>Story of Kennett</i>; Trowbridge's <i>The
Three Scouts</i>; Donald G. Mitchell's <i>Doctor Johns</i>; Holmes's
<i>The Guardian Angel</i>; Lanier's <i>Tiger-Lilies</i>, the transition novel
of the decade as we shall see later in our study of Lanier; Louisa
M. Alcott's <i>Little Women</i>; Beecher's <i>Norwood</i>; Elizabeth Stuart
Phelps's <i>The Gates Ajar</i>; Higginson's <i>Malbone</i>; Aldrich's <i>Story
of a Bad Boy</i>; and Mrs. Stowe's <i>Oldtown Folks</i>. To study the
list is to realize the condition of American fiction during the sixties.
It lacked incisiveness and construction and definite color;
it droned and it preached.</p>

<p>Before pronouncing the decade the feeblest period in American
fiction since the early twenties of the century, let us examine
the most lauded novel written in America between 1860
and 1870, <i>Elsie Venner</i> (1861). Strictly speaking, it is not a
novel at all: it is another Autocrat volume, chatty, discursive,
brilliant. The Brahmins, sons and grandsons of ministers,
might enter the law, medicine, teaching, literature, the lyceum
lecture field&mdash;they never ceased to preach. New England for
two centuries was a vast pulpit and American literature during
a whole period was written on sermon paper. "The real
aim of the story," the Autocrat naïvely observes in his preface,
"was to test the doctrine of 'original sin' and human responsibility."
He is in no hurry, however. We read four chapters
before we learn even the heroine's name. A novel can reasonably
be expected to center about its title character: Elsie Venner
speaks seventeen times during the story, and eleven of these
utterances are delivered from her death-bed at the close of the
book. There is no growth in character, no gradual moving of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
events to a culmination, no clear picture even of the central figure.
Elsie is a mere case: the book, so far as she is concerned,
is the record of a clinic. But even the clinic is not suffered to
move uninterruptedly. Digressions are as frequent as even in
the Autocrat papers. A widow is introduced for no apparent
reason, studied for a chapter, and then dropped from the narrative.
We never feel like one who has lost himself for a time
in the life of another in a new world under new skies; we feel
rather like one who is being personally conducted through New
England by a skilful guide. Note this partial prospectus of
what he has to show: Newburyport, Portsmouth, Portland,
caste in New England, rural schools, Northampton and Mt.
Holyoke, mountain vegetation, rattlesnakes in Massachusetts,
the New England mansion house, school compositions, the old
type of meeting house, varieties of school girls, the old-time
India merchant, oysters in New England, hired help, colonial
chimneys, young ladies' seminaries, the hemlock tree. The topics
are interesting ones and they are brilliantly treated, often at
length, but in a novel, even one written by Dr. Holmes, such
things are "lumber." The novel is typical of the fiction of the
era. It is discursive, loosely constructed, vague in its characterization,
and lacking in cumulative force.</p>

<p>It is significant that the magazines of the period had very
little use for the native product. Between 1864 and 1870,
<i>Harper's Magazine</i> alone published no fewer than ten long serials
by English novelists: <i>Denis Duval</i> by Thackeray; <i>The Small
House at Allington</i> by Trollope; <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> by Dickens;
<i>The Unkind Word</i>, <i>Woman's Kingdom</i>, and <i>A Brave Lady</i> by
Dinah Mulock Craik; <i>Armadale</i> by Wilkie Collins; <i>My Enemy's
Daughter</i> by Justin M'Carthy; <i>Anteros</i> by the Author of <i>Guy
Livingstone</i> [G.&nbsp;A. Lawrence]; and <i>Anne Furness</i> by the Author
of <i>Mabel's Progress</i> [Mrs. T.&nbsp;A. Trollope]. Even the <i>Atlantic
Monthly</i> left its New England group of producers to publish
Charles Reade's <i>Griffith Gaunt</i> in twelve instalments. In 1871
<i>Scribner's Monthly</i> began the prospectus of its second volume
with this announcement:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Our contributors are among the best who write in the English language.
George MacDonald&mdash;"the best of living story-writers"&mdash;will
continue his beautiful story, entitled <i>Wilfred Cumbermede</i>, throughout
the volume. We have the refusal of all Hans Christian Andersen's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
stories at the hand of his best translator, Mr. Horace E. Scudder. We
have engaged the pen of Miss Thackeray, now regarded as the finest
story-writer among the gifted women of Great Britain&mdash;not even excepting
George Eliot. Mrs. Oliphant has written especially for us an
exquisitely characteristic story, etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>The feebleness of the period was understood even at the time.
Charles Eliot Norton wrote Lowell in 1874: "There is not much
in the magazine [<i>Atlantic</i>] that is likely to be read twice save
by its writers, and this is what the great public likes. There
must be a revival of letters in America, if literature as an art is
not to become extinct. You should hear Godkin express himself
in private on this <span class="locked">topic."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>No wonder that the book-reviewer of <i>Harper's Magazine</i> for
May, 1870, with nothing better before him than <i>Miss Van Kortland</i>,
Anonymous; <i>Hedged In</i>, by Miss Phelps; and <i>Askaros
Kassis</i>, by DeLeon, should have begun his review, "We are so
weary of depending on England, France, and Germany for fiction,
and so hungry for some genuine American romance, that we
are not inclined to read very critically the three characteristic
American novels which lie on our table." No wonder that when
Harte's <i>The Luck of Roaring Camp</i> in the <i>Overland Monthly</i>
was read in the <i>Atlantic</i> office, Fields sent by return mail a request
"upon the most flattering terms" for another story like it,
and that the same mail brought also papers and reviews "welcoming
the little foundling of California literature with an enthusiasm
that half frightened its <span class="locked">author."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>The new American fiction began with Bret Harte.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>To turn from Mark Twain to Bret Harte is like turning from
the great river on a summer night, fragrant and star-lit, to the
glamour and unreality of the city theater. No contrast could be
more striking. Francis Brett Harte, born August 25, 1839, was
preëminently a man of the East and preëminently also a man
of the city. He was born at Albany, New York, he spent his
childhood in Providence, Rhode Island, in Philadelphia, in
Lowell, Massachusetts, in Boston and other places, and the
formative years between nine and eighteen he passed in Brooklyn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
and New York City. He lived all his young life in an atmosphere
of culture. His father, a Union College man, a scholar,
and a teacher who knew French and Spanish and Italian, Latin
and Greek, had accumulated a large and well-selected library in
which the boy, frail and sensitive, too frail in his early years
to attend school, spent much of his childhood, reading Shakespeare
and Froissart at six and Charles Dickens at seven. His
mother, a woman of culture, directed his reading, and criticized
with discernment his earliest attempts at poetry. It was the
training school for a poet, a Bryant or a Longfellow, who should
look to the older art for models and be inspired with the dream
that had sent Irving and Willis and Taylor as pilgrims to the
holy lands of literature across the sea.</p>

<p>The turning point in Harte's life came in 1854, when he was
in his fifteenth year. His biographer, Merwin, tells the story:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In 1853 his mother [who had been a widow for nine years] went to
California with a party of relatives and friends, in order to make her
home there with her elder son, Henry. She had intended to take with
her the other two children, Margaret and Francis Brett; but as the
daughter was in school, she left the two behind for a few months, and
they followed in February, 1854. They traveled by the Nicaragua
route, and after a long, tiresome, but uneventful journey, landed safely
in San <span class="locked">Francisco.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>The mother must have remarried shortly after her arrival in
California, for two sentences later on the biographer records
that "They went the next morning to Oakland across the Bay,
where their mother and her second husband, Colonel Andrew
Williams, were living."</p>

<p>The young poet had been transplanted into new and strange
soil and he took root slowly. During the next year, making
his home with his mother at Oakland, he attempted to teach
school and then to serve as an apothecary's assistant, but he
made little headway in either profession. His heart was far
away from the rough, new land that he had entered. He wrote
poems and stories and sketches and sent them to the Eastern
magazines; he read interminably, and dreamed of literature just
as Aldrich and Timrod and Hayne and Stedman and Stoddard
were even then dreaming of it on the other side of the continent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
The next two years of his life, despite the efforts of his biographers,
are vague and conjectural. It was his wander
period. He began as tutor in a private family in Humboldt
County, then, according to Charles Warren Stoddard, "he was
an express messenger in the mountains when the office was the
target of every lawless rifle in the territory; he was glutted with
adventurous <span class="locked">experiences."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></span> Not for long, however. He seems
to have spent the rest of the two years&mdash;prosaic anticlimax!&mdash;as
a type-setter on the <i>Humboldt Times</i> and the <i>Northern California</i>,
as a teacher in the town of Union, and as a drug clerk.
That he ever was a miner is gravely to be doubted. He had
small taste for roughing it and little sympathy with the typical
California life of the times. He was a poet, rather, a man of
the city, a reader of romance, how wide and attentive a reader
we may judge from <i>Condensed Novels</i> which he soon after began
to contribute to the San Francisco press.</p>

<p>The events in his life during the next fourteen years in San
Francisco are quickly summarized. For the greater part of it he
was connected with the <i>Golden Era</i>, first as a type-setter and
later as an editor and contributor. In 1862 he was married.
Two years later he was appointed Secretary of the California
Mint, an office that allowed him abundant time for literary
work. He was connected with Webb's brilliant and short-lived
<i>Californian</i>, first as contributor and later as editor, and in 1868,
when the <i>Overland Monthly</i>, which was to be the <i>Atlantic</i> of
Western America, was founded, he was made the editor. <i>The
Luck of Roaring Camp</i> in the second number and <i>Plain Language
from Truthful James</i> in the September, 1870, number,
brought him a popularity that in suddenness and extent had had
no precedent in America, save in the case of Mrs. Stowe and
<i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>. The enormous applause intoxicated him;
California became too narrow and provincial; and in 1871 he
left it, joyous as one who is returning home after long exile.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>If we may trust Harte's own statement, made, it must be
remembered, in the retrospect of later years, he set out deliberately
to add a new province to American literature. During<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
the period between 1862 and 1867, he wrote, according to his
own statement, "<i>The Society upon the Stanislaus</i> and <i>The Story
of M'liss</i>&mdash;the first a dialectical poem, the second a California
romance&mdash;his first efforts toward indicating a peculiarly characteristic
Western American literature. He would like to offer
these facts as evidence of his very early, half-boyish, but very enthusiastic
belief in such a possibility&mdash;a belief which never deserted
him, and which, a few years later, from the better known
pages of the <i>Overland Monthly</i>, he was able to demonstrate to a
larger and more cosmopolitan audience in the story of <i>The
Luck of Roaring Camp</i>, and the poem of <i>The Heathen Chinee</i>."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>But the poem and the romance were not his first efforts toward
a peculiarly characteristic Western American literature. His
first vision of the literary possibilities of the region had been inspired
by Irving, and he wrote in the <i>Sketch Book</i> manner during
the greater part of his seventeen years upon the Pacific Coast.
Behind the California of the gold and the excitement lay three
hundred years of an old Spanish civilization. What Irving had
done for the Hudson why could he not do for the Mission lands
and the Spanish occupation, "that glorious Indian summer of
California history, around which so much poetical haze still lingers&mdash;that
bland, indolent autumn of Spanish rule, so soon to
be followed by the wintry storms of Mexican independence and
the reviving springs of American conquest"?<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> It was a vision
worthy of a Hawthorne. That it possessed him for years and
was abandoned with reluctance is evident to one who examines
his early work.</p>

<p>He voiced it in <i>The Angelus, Heard at the Mission Dolores,
1868</i>, in the same volume of the <i>Overland Monthly</i> that contained
<i>The Luck of Roaring Camp</i>:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span></p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Borne on the swell of your long waves receding,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I touch the further Past&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I see the dying glow of Spanish glory,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The sunset dream and last.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Before me rise the dome-shaped Mission towers;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The white Presidio;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The swart commander in his leathern jerkin,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The priest in stole of snow.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Once more I see Portata's cross uplifting<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Above the setting sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And past the headland, northward, slowly drifting<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The freighted galleon.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>It must not be forgotten that his <i>Legend of Monte del Diablo</i>,
a careful Irvingesque romance, appeared in the <i>Atlantic
Monthly</i> as early as 1863. During the same period he wrote
<i>The Right Eye of the Commander</i>, <i>The Legend of Devil's Point</i>,
<i>The Adventure of Padre Viventio</i>, and many short pieces, enough,
indeed, to make up a volume the size of <i>The Sketch Book</i>.</p>

<p>Despite its echoes of Irving, it is significant work. Harte
was the first to catch sight of a whole vast field of American
romance. Again and again he recurs to it in his later poetry
and prose; notably in <i>Concepcion de Arguello</i> and its prose version
on page 191 of the first volume of the <i>Overland Monthly</i>, <i>A
Convert of the Mission</i>, <i>The Story of a Mine</i>, <i>In the Carquinez
Woods</i>, and in <i>Gabriel Conroy</i>, that chaotic book which has in it
the materials for the greatest of American romances. Whenever
he touches this old Spanish land he throws over it the mellow
Washington Irving glow that had so thrilled him in his
earlier years, and he writes with power. The Spanish part of
<i>Gabriel Conroy</i> is exquisite; its atmosphere is faultless:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If there was a spot on earth of which the usual dead monotony of
the California seasons seemed a perfectly consistent and natural expression,
that spot was the ancient and time-honored <i>pueblo</i> and Mission
of the blessed St. Anthony. The changeless, cloudless, expressionless
skies of the summer seemed to symbolize that aristocratic conservatism
which expelled all innovation and was its distinguishing mark....</p>

<p>As he drew rein in the court-yard of the first large <i>adobe</i> dwelling,
and received the grave welcome of a strange but kindly face, he saw
around him everywhere the past unchanged. The sun shone as brightly
and fiercely on the long red tiles of the low roofs, that looked as if
they had been thatched with longitudinal slips of cinnamon, even as it
had shone for the last hundred years; the gaunt wolf-like dogs ran out
and barked at him as their fathers and mothers had barked at the preceding
stranger of twenty years before. There were the few wild, half-broken
mustangs tethered by strong riatas before the veranda of the
long low <i>Fonda</i>, with the sunlight glittering on their silver trappings;
there were the broad, blank expanses of whitewashed <i>adobe</i> wall, as
barren and guiltless of record as the uneventful days, as monotonous
and expressionless as the staring sky above; there were the white,
dome-shaped towers of the Mission rising above the green of olives and
pear trees, twisted, gnarled and knotted with the rheumatism of age.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
... The steamers that crept slowly up the darkening coast line were
something remote, unreal, and phantasmal; since the Philippine galleon
had left its bleached and broken ribs in the sand in 1640, no vessel had,
in the memory of man, dropped anchor in the open roadstead below the
curving Point of Pines.</p></blockquote>

<p>Meager and fragmentary as these Spanish sketches are, they
nevertheless opened the way for a new school of American romance.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Harte's first story with other than a legendary theme was
<i>M'liss</i>, written for the <i>Golden Era</i> sometime before 1867. For
the student of his literary art it is the most important of all his
writings, especially important because of the revision which he
made of it later after he had evolved his final manner. It is
transition work. The backgrounds are traced in with Irving-like
care; the character of the schoolmaster is done with artistic
restraint and certainty of touch. M'liss is exquisitely handled.
There is nothing better in all his work than this study of the
fiery, jealous little heart of the neglected child. It is not necessarily
a California story; it could have happened as well even
in New England. It is not <i>genre</i> work, not mere exploiting
of local oddities; it is worked out in life itself, and it strikes the
universal human chord that brings it into the realm of true art.</p>

<p>But even in the earlier version of the story there are false
notes. The names of the characters strike us as unusual:
M'liss, McSnagley, Morpher, Clytemnestra, Kerg, Aristides, Cellerstina.
We feel that the author is straining for the unusual;
and we feel it more when the Rev. Joshua McSnagley comes upon
the scene:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The reverend gentleman was glad to see him. Moreover, he observed
that the master was looking "peartish," and hoped he had got over the
"neuralgy" and "rheumatiz." He himself had been troubled with the
dumb "ager" since last conference. But he had learned to "rastle and
pray." Pausing a moment to enable the master to write his certain
method of curing the dumb "ager" upon the book and volume of his
brain, Mr. McSnagley proceeded to inquire after Sister Morpher.
"She is an adornment to Christewanity, and has a likely growin' young
family," added Mr. McSnagley.</p></blockquote>

<p>Somehow it does not ring true. The author is thinking of
the effect he hopes to produce. He must fill his reader with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
wonder. "A saintly Raphael-face, with blond beard and soft
blue eyes, belonging to the biggest scamp in the diggings, turned
toward the child and whispered, 'Stick to it, M'liss.'" That
sentence is the key to the author's later manner. "Life in California
is a paradox," he seems everywhere to say, "just look at
this."</p>

<p>The transition from F.&nbsp;B. Harte the poet and romancer to Bret
Harte the paradox maker and showman came through Dickens.
It was the Dickens era in America. The great novelist had made
his second tour of the country between November, 1867, and
April, 1868, and his journeyings had been a triumphal progress.
All classes everywhere were reading his books, and great numbers
knew them literally by heart. Dickens wrote home from Washington,
"Mr. Secretary Staunton (War Minister) was here....
He is acquainted with the minutest details of my books. Give
him a passage anywhere and he will instantly cap it and go on
with the context.... Never went to sleep at night without first
reading something from my books which were always with
<span class="locked">him."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></span> The same could have been said of Harte himself. Says
Pemberton, "His knowledge of his [Dickens's] books was unrivaled....
He could have passed Charles Calverley's famous
Pickwick Examination Paper with <span class="locked">honors."<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></span> Everybody knew
his Dickens; for a generation men could not speak of the man
with moderation. Even a critic like Moncure D. Conway could
say of <i>Oliver Twist</i> and <i>The Old Curiosity Shop</i>: "To this day
I cannot help suspecting the sanity of any one who does not concede
that they are the two best novels ever <span class="locked">written."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></span> The
death of Dickens in 1870 let loose all over America a flood of
eulogy and increased enormously the already great sales of his
books.</p>

<p>The art of Dickens was peculiar. He had found in the lower
strata of the population of London, that vast settling pool of Great
Britain, a society made up of many sharply individualized personalities,
abnormalities in body and soul, results of the peculiar
inflexible characteristics of the English race and their hard and
fast social distinctions. From fragments of this lower London
Dickens built him a world of his own and peopled it with composite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
creations such as one finds nowhere save in the folklore
of a primitive people&mdash;creatures as strange as their names, Quilp,
Scrooge, Cratchit, Squeers, Snagsby. So tremendously did he believe
in them, that we believe in them ourselves. So overflowing
was he with high spirits and boisterous laughter that before we
realize it we have surrendered completely and are living hilariously
not in a land of actual men and women, but in the world
that never was and never can be save in the books of Dickens.
He never analyzed, he never sought the heart of things, or got
at all below the surface of his characters; he was content simply
to exhibit his marvelous creations with all their ludicrous incongruities,
and the show is so entertaining and the showman exhibits
it with such zest, such joyous abandon, that we stand like
children and lose ourselves in wonder and enjoyment.</p>

<p>We can see now that the time was ripe for a California
Dickens. There was a prepared audience&mdash;the whole nation was
reading the great novelist of the people. California, moreover,
was in the fierce light of the gold excitement&mdash;anything that
came from it would find eager readers. It was a veritable
Dickens land, more full of strange types than even the slums of
London: Pikes, Greasers, Yankees, Chinese, gamblers, adventurers
from all the wild places of the world, desperadoes, soldiers
of fortune, restless seekers for excitement and gold. Everything
was ready. Harte doubtless blundered into his success; doubtless
he did not reason about the matter at all, yet the result remains
the same: he came at the precise moment with the precise
form of literature that the world was most sure to accept. It
came about as the most natural thing in the world. Saturated
with Dickens as he had been from his childhood, it is not strange
that this motley society and its amazing surroundings should
have appealed to him from the objective and the picturesque
side; it is not strange that, even as did Dickens, he should have
selected types and heightened them and peopled a new world
with them; it is not strange that he should have given these types
Dickens-like names: Miggles, McCorkle, Culpepper Starbottle,
Calhoun Bungstarter, Fagg, Twinkler, Rattler, Mixer, Stubbs,
Nibbles. His work is redolent of Dickens. Sometimes we seem
to be reading a clever parody after the fashion of the <i>Condensed
Novels</i>, as for instance this from <i>The Romance of Madrono Hollow</i>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>There was not much to hear. The hat was saying to the ribbons that
it was a fine night, and remarking generally upon the clear outline of
the Sierras against the blue-black sky. The ribbons, it so appeared,
had admired this all the way home, and asked the hat if it had ever
seen anything half so lovely as the moonlight on the summit? The
hat never had; it recalled some lovely nights in the South in Alabama
("in the South in Ahlabahm" was the way the old man had heard it),
but then there were other things that made the night seem so pleasant.
The ribbons could not possibly conceive what the hat could be thinking
about. At this point there was a pause, of which Mr. Folinsbee availed
himself to walk very grimly and craunchingly down the gravel walk
toward the gate. Then the hat was lifted, and disappeared in the
shadow, and Mr. Folinsbee confronted only the half-foolish, half-mischievous,
but wholly pretty face of his daughter.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>M'liss</i> is full of such echoes. A little later than <i>M'liss</i>, when
he was required to furnish the <i>Overland</i> with a distinctly Californian
story, he set about examining his field precisely as
Dickens would have done. "What are some of the most unusual
phases of this unique epoch?" he asked himself. During a
short period women and children were rare in the remote mining
districts. What would result if a baby were born in one of the
roughest and most masculine of the camps? It is not hard to
conjecture how Dickens would have handled the problem; <i>The
Luck of Roaring Camp</i> is Harte's solution. The situation and
the characters are both unique. They would have been impossible
in any other place or at any other moment in the world's
history. So with all of Harte's later stories: undoubtedly there
may have been a Roaring Camp and undoubtedly there were
Cherokee Sals and Kentucks, undoubtedly the gold rush developed
here and there Jack Hamlins and Tennessees and Uncle
Billys and Yuba Bills. The weakness of Harte is that he takes
these and peoples California with them. Like Dickens, he selects
a few picturesque and grotesque exceptions and makes of them a
whole social system.</p>

<p>Harte had nothing of the earnestness and the sincerity of the
older master; after a time he outgrew his manner, and evolved a
style of his own&mdash;compressed, rapid, picturesque; but this early
point of view he never changed. He sought ever for the startling
and the dramatic and he elaborated the outside of it with care.
He studied the map of California for picturesque names, just
as Dickens studied the street signs of London. He passed by
the common materials of human life to exhibit the strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
phenomena of one single accidental moment in a corner of
America.</p>

<p>Once he had begun, however, there was no possibility of stopping.
The people demanded work like <i>The Luck of Roaring
Camp</i> and would accept nothing else. It is pathetic to see him
during the early years of his great fame, trying to impress upon
the reading public that he is a poet after the old definition of
the word. The <i>Atlantic</i> had paid him $10,000 to write for a
year work like <i>The Luck of Roaring Camp</i>. He gave four
stories, and he gave also five careful poems of the Longfellow-Whittier
type. By 1873 he had put forth no fewer than fourteen
books, nine of them being poems or collections of his poetry. In
vain. The public ordered him back to the mines and camps that
even then were as obsolete as the pony express across the Plains.</p>

<p>Despite his biographers, the latter part of his life is full of
mystery. After seven years of literary work in New York City,
he went in 1878 as consul to Crefeld, Germany. Two years later
he was transferred to Glasgow, Scotland, where he remained for
five years. The rest of his life he spent in London, writing year
after year new books of California stories. He never returned
to America; he was estranged from his family; he seemed to
wish to sever himself entirely from all that had to do with his
earlier life. He died May 5, 1902, and was buried in Frimby
churchyard, in Surrey.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>A novelist must rise or fall with his characters. What of
Harte? First of all we must observe that he makes no attempts
at character development. Each personage introduced is the
same at the close of the story as at the opening. He has no fully
studied character: we have a burning moment, a flashlight
glimpse&mdash;intense, paradoxical, startling, then no more. We
never see the person again. The name may appear in later
sketches, but it never designates the same man. Colonel Starbottle
is consistent from story to story only in make-up, in stage
"business," and the well known "gags"&mdash;as, for instance, a succession
of phrases qualified by the adjective "blank." "Yuba
Bill" is Harte's synonym for stage driver, "Jack Hamlin" for
gambler. We have a feeling constantly that the characters are
brought in simply to excite wonder. Gabriel Conroy devotes his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
life for years to the finding of his sister Grace. He leaves his
wife to search for her; he can think of nothing else; yet when at
length he does find her among the witnesses in a courtroom he
takes it as a mere commonplace. A moment later, however,
when told that his wife, for whom we know he cares nothing at
all, has given birth to a son, he falls headlong in a swoon.</p>

<p>His characters may perhaps be true to facts; he may be able
to give the prototype in every case; and yet we are not convinced.
The stories told by the college freshman at home during his first
Christmas vacation may all be true, and yet they may give a
very false idea of college life in its entirety. So it is with Harte.
The very year that he landed in California a procession of one
thousand children, each child with a flower in his hand, marched
one day in San Francisco. <i>The Luck of Roaring Camp</i> gives no
such impression. In all save the remotest camps there were
churches and worshipers, yet who would suspect it from Harte's
tales? California has never accepted Harte's picture of its life,
just as the South has never accepted <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>. It is
not fair to picture an era simply by dwelling on its exceptions
and its grotesque possibilities. Art must rest upon the whole
truth, not upon half truths.</p>

<p>The truth is that the man had no deep and abiding philosophy
of life; he had indeed no philosophy at all. In the words of his
discerning biographer, Merwin,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There was a want of background, both intellectual and moral, in his
nature. He was an observer, not a thinker, and his genius was shown
only as he lived in the life of others. Even his poetry is dramatic, not
lyric. It was very seldom that Bret Harte, in his tales or elsewhere,
advanced any abstract sentiment or idea; he was concerned only with
the concrete; and it is noticeable that when he does venture to lay down
a general principle, it fails to bear the impress of real conviction. The
note of sincerity is <span class="locked">wanting.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>The fact that his rascals in a crisis often do deeds of sublime
heroism must not deceive us, despite the author's protestations
of a great moral purpose underlying his work.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Without claiming to be a religious man or a moralist, but simply as
an artist, he shall reverently and humbly conform to the rules laid
down by a Great Poet who created the parables of the Prodigal Son
and the Good Samaritan, whose works have lasted eighteen hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
years, and will remain when the present writer and his generation are
forgotten. And he is conscious of uttering no original doctrine in this,
but of only voicing the beliefs of a few of his literary brethren happily
living, and one gloriously dead, who never made proclamation of this
from the <span class="locked">housetops.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>This is insincere to the point of bathos. We feel like saying,
"Bah!" Harte makes his villains heroes at the crisis simply
to add <i>finesse</i> to his tale. He is dealing with paradoxes; he is
working for his reader's wonder. If in a moment where pity is
expected, woman is harsh and man tender; if the reputed good
man is a rascal at the supreme test, and the reputed rascal proves
suddenly to be a saint, it adds to the effectiveness of the tale.</p>

<p>Everywhere there is the atmosphere of the theater. The
painted backgrounds are marvels of skill. There are vast color
effects, and picturesque tableaux. There is a theatric quality
about the heroines; we can see the make-up upon their faces.
Too often they talk the stagiest of stage talk as in the first parting
scene between Grace Conroy and Arthur Poinset. The end is
always a drop-curtain effect. Even <i>Tennessee's Partner</i> must
have its appropriate curtain. We can imagine a double curtain
for <i>The Outcasts of Poker Flat</i>: the first tableau showing the two
dead women in the snow, the second the inscription over the body
of Oakhurst, the gambler. Instead of closing the book with a
long breath as after looking at a quivering section of human life,
we say, "How strange! What brilliant work!" and we feel like
clapping our hands for a tableau of all the cast, the spot light,
and the quick curtain.</p>

<p>Bret Harte had no real affection for the West; he never again
visited it; he never even wrote to the friends he had left there.
With Mark Twain it was greatly different. The West to him
was home; he loved it; he recorded its deepest life with sympathy.
To Harte it was simply a source of literary material.
He skimmed its surface and found only the melodramatic and
the sensational.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>And yet after all the real strength of Bret Harte came from
his contact with this Western soil. Irving and Dickens and the
early models that had so molded him served only to teach him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
his trade; the breath of life in his works all came from the
new life of the West. It would be impossible for one to live
during seventeen years of his early life in an atmosphere like
that of the west coast and not be transformed by it. Taking
his work altogether there is in it far more of California than
there is of Dickens or of all the others of the older writers.
Only a few things of the life of the West seem to have impressed
him. He lived fifteen years in San Francisco yet we see almost
nothing of that city in his work; the dramatic career of the
Vigilantes he touched upon almost not at all. He selected the
remote mining camps for his field and yet he seems to have been
impressed by very few of the types that were found in them.
Only a few of them ring true at every point, Yuba Bill the
stage driver is one. We feel that he was drawn by a master who
has actually lived with his model. Yuba Bill is the typical man
of the region and the period&mdash;masterful, self-reliant, full of a
humor that is elemental. There is no prolonged study of him.
We see him for a tense moment as the stage swings up to the
station, and then he is gone. He is as devoid of sentimentality
as even Horace Bixby. The company have been shouting
"Miggles!" at the dark cabin but have got no reply save from
what proves later to have been a parrot:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Extraordinary echo," said the Judge.</p>

<p>"Extraordinary d&mdash;d skunk!" roared the driver contemptuously.
"Come out of that, Miggles, and show yourself. Be a man."</p>

<p>Miggles, however, did not appear.</p>

<p>Yuba Bill hesitated no longer. Taking a heavy stone from the road,
he battered down the gate, and with the expressman entered the enclosure....</p>

<p>"Do you know this Miggles?" asked the Judge of Yuba Bill.</p>

<p>"No, nor don't want to," said Bill shortly.</p>

<p>"But, my dear sir," expostulated the Judge, as he thought of the
barred gate.</p>

<p>"Lookee here," said Yuba Bill, with fine irony, "hadn't you better
go back and sit in the coach till yer introduced? I'm going in," and
he pushed open the door of the building.</p></blockquote>

<p>That rings true. If one were obliged to ride at night over a
wild, road-agent-infested trail there is no character in all fiction
whom we would more gladly have for driver than Yuba Bill.
We would like to see more of him than the brief glimpses allowed
us by his creator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
The humor in Harte is largely Western humor. There is the
true California ring in such conversations, for instance, as those
in the earlier pages of <i>Uncle Jim and Uncle Billy</i>. It is an
atmosphere rather than a series of hits. One finds it in <i>The
Outcasts of Poker Flat</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A few of the committee had urged hanging him [Oakhurst] as a possible
example, and a sure method of reimbursing themselves from his
pockets of the sums he had won from them. "It's agin justice," said
Jim Wheeler, "to let this yer young man from Roaring Camp&mdash;an entire
stranger&mdash;carry away our money." But a crude sentiment of
equity residing in the breasts of those who had been fortunate enough
to win from Mr. Oakhurst overruled this narrower local prejudice.</p></blockquote>

<p>This atmosphere of humor shimmers through all of the stories.
There is never uproarious merriment, but there is constant humor.
The conjugal troubles of the "old man" in <i>How Santa Claus
Came to Simpson's Bar</i> are thus touched upon:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>His first wife, a delicate, pretty little woman, had suffered keenly and
secretly from the jealous suspicions of her husband, until one day he
invited the whole Bar to his house to expose her infidelity. On arriving,
the party found the shy, <i>petite</i> creature quietly engaged in her
household duties and retired abashed and discomfited. But the sensitive
woman did not easily recover from her shock of this extraordinary
outrage. It was with difficulty she regained her equanimity sufficiently
to release her lover from the closet in which he was concealed and
escape with him. She left a boy of three years to comfort her bereaved
husband. The old man's present wife had been his cook. She
was large, loyal, and aggressive.</p></blockquote>

<p>His characters are exceptions and his situations are theatric,
yet for all that he cannot be ignored. He caught the spirit of
the early mining camps and with it the romantic atmosphere of
the old Spanish Colonial civilization that was swept away by the
Anglo-Saxon rush for gold. His name cannot fail to go down
with the era he recorded, and to identify oneself forever with an
era, even though that era be a brief and restricted one, is no
small achievement. He is the writer of the epic of the gold rush
of the middle century in America, and whatever the quality of
that epic may be, it can never be forgotten. He said in 1868:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It may not have been an heroic era; it may have been a hard, ugly,
unworked, vulgar and lawless era; but of such are heroes and aristocracies
born. Three hundred years, and what a glamor shall hang
about it!... A thousand years, and a new Virgil sings the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
Æneid with the episode of Jason and the California golden fleece, and
the historians tell us it is a myth! Laugh, my pioneer friends, but
your great-great-great-great-grandchildren shall weep reverential tears.
History, as was said of martyrdom, is "mean in the making" but how
heroic it becomes in the perspective of five centuries!<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>And in many ways his work is really of epic strength. He dealt
with elemental men, often with veritable demigods, as Yuba
Bill. His canvases are as broad as those even of Mark Twain.
His human drama is played before a truly Western background.
While Tennessee is being tried for his life, "Above all this,
etched on the dark firmament, rose the Sierra, remote and passionless,
crowned with remoter passionless stars." At moments
of crisis the narrative always moves with power. The wolves
and the fire in the story <i>In the Carquinez Woods</i> are intensely
vivid and lurid in their presentation. The ride from Simpson's
Bar is told with the graphic thrill of an eye-witness, and the
description of the snow-storm at the opening of <i>Gabriel Conroy</i>
reminds one of Thomas Hardy.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Finally, Harte was the parent of the modern form of the short
story. It was he who started Kipling and Cable and Thomas
Nelson Page. Few indeed have surpassed him in the mechanics
of this most difficult of arts. According to his own belief, the
form is an American product. We can do no better than to
quote from his essay on <i>The Rise of the Short Story</i>. It traces
the evolution of a peculiarly American addition to literature.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>But while the American literary imagination was still under the
influence of English tradition, an unexpected factor was developing to
diminish its power. It was <i>humor</i>, of a quality as distinct and original
as the country and civilization in which it was developed. It was first
noticeable in the anecdote or "story," and, after the fashion of such
beginnings, was orally transmitted. It was common in the bar-rooms,
the gatherings in the "country store," and finally at public meetings in
the mouths of "stump orators." Arguments were clinched and political
principles illustrated by "a funny story." It invaded even the camp
meeting and pulpit. It at last received the currency of the public
press. But wherever met it was so distinctly original and novel, so
individual and characteristic, that it was at once known and appreciated
abroad as "an American story." Crude at first, it received a literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
polish in the press, but its dominant quality remained. It was concise
and condense, yet suggestive. It was delightfully extravagant, or a
miracle of under-statement. It voiced not only the dialect, but the
habits of thought of a people or locality. It gave a new interest to
slang. From a paragraph of a dozen lines it grew into half a column,
but always retaining its conciseness and felicity of statement. It was
a foe to prolixity of any kind; it admitted no fine writing nor affectation
of style. It went directly to the point. It was burdened by no
conscientiousness; it was often irreverent; it was devoid of all moral
responsibility, but it was original! By degrees it developed character
with its incident, often, in a few lines, gave a striking photograph of
a community or a section, but always reached its conclusion without an
unnecessary word. It became&mdash;and still exists as&mdash;an essential feature
of newspaper literature. It was the parent of the American "short
<span class="locked">story."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>Harte has described the genesis of his own art. It sprang
from the Western humor and was developed by the circumstances
that surrounded him. Many of his short stories are models.
They contain not a superfluous word; they handle a single incident
with graphic power; they close without moral or comment.
The form came as a natural evolution from his limitations and
powers. With him the story must of necessity be brief. He who
depicts the one good deed in a wicked life must of necessity use
a small canvas. At one moment in his career Jack Hamlin or
Mother Shipton or Sandy does a truly heroic deed, but the
author must not extend his inquiries too far. To make a novel
with Mother Shipton as heroine would be intolerable.</p>

<p>Harte was unable to hold himself long to any one effort. Like
Byron, he must bring down his quarry at a single spring; he had
no patience to pursue it at length. <i>Gabriel Conroy</i> is at the
same time the best and the worst American novel of the century.
It is the best in its wealth of truly American material and in the
brilliant passages that strew its pages; it is the worse in that it
utterly fails in its construction, and that it builds up its characters
wholly from the outside. Its hero, moreover, changes his
personality completely three times during the story, and its
heroine is first an uneducated Pike maiden of the Southwest,
then a Spanish señorita:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Features small, and perfectly modeled; the outline of the small face
was a perfect oval, but the complection was of burnished copper.... The
imperious habit of command; an almost despotic control of a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>hundred
servants; a certain barbaric contempt for the unlimited revenues
at her disposal that prompted the act, became her wonderfully. In her
impatience the quick blood glanced through her bronzed cheek, her little
slipper tapped the floor imperiously and her eyes flashed in the darkness.</p></blockquote>

<p>Later we learn that she had been adopted into this Spanish
family after her lover had abandoned her in the earlier chapters,
and had been given her complexion by means of a vegetable
stain. But there is still another lightning change. At the end
of the book she becomes a Pike again and weakly marries the
unrepentant rascal who earlier had betrayed her. In the words
of Artemus Ward, "it is too much." It is not even good melodrama,
for in melodrama the villain is punished at the end.</p>

<p>Bret Harte was the artist of impulse, the painter of single
burning moments, the flashlight photographer who caught in
lurid detail one dramatic episode in the life of a man or a community
and left the rest in darkness.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>In his later years Harte's backgrounds became less sharp in
outline. His methods grew more romantic; his atmospheres
more mellow and golden. The old Spanish dream of the days
of his early art possessed him again, and he added to his gallery
of real creations&mdash;M'liss, Yuba Bill, Jack Hamlin, Tennessee's
Partner&mdash;one that perhaps is the strongest of them all, Enriquez
Saltillo, the last of a fading race. Nothing Harte ever did will
surpass that creation of his old age. In <i>Chu Chu</i>, <i>The Devotion
of Enriquez</i>, and <i>The Passing of Enriquez</i> we have the fitting
close of the work of the romancer of the west coast. For once
at least he saw into the heart of a man. Listen to Enriquez as
he makes his defense:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Then they say, "Dry up, and sell out"; and the great bankers say,
"Name your own price for your stock, and resign." And I say, "There
is not gold enough in your bank, in your San Francisco, in the mines
of California, that shall buy a Spanish gentleman. When I leave, I
leave the stock at my back; I shall take it, nevarre!" Then the banker
he say, "And you will go and blab, I suppose?" And then, Pancho, I
smile, I pick up my mustache&mdash;so! and I say: "Pardon, señor, you
haf mistake. The Saltillo haf for three hundred year no stain, no
blot upon him. Eet is not now&mdash;the last of the race&mdash;who shall confess
that he haf sit at a board of disgrace and dishonor!" And then it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
is that the band begin to play, and the animals stand on their hind legs
and waltz, and behold, the row he haf begin.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is the atmosphere of romance, for the mine which had caused
all the trouble had been in the family three hundred years and
it had become a part of the family itself. When it passed
into the hands of the new régime, when his wife, who also
was of the new régime, deserted him, then passed Enriquez.
The earth that for three hundred years had borne his fathers
opened at the earthquake and took him to herself. It was the
conception of a true romancer. The work of Bret Harte opened
and closed with a vision of romance, a vision worthy even of a
Hawthorne.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE DISCOVERY OF PIKE COUNTY</span></h2>

<p>The new era of vulgarity in literature, complained of by Stedman,
came as a revolt against mid-century tendencies. The
movement was not confined to America. In the early seventies,
as we have seen, Millet and his Breton peasants for a time took
possession of French art; Hardy with his Wessex natives caught
the ear of England; Björnson made the discovery that in the
Scandinavian peasant lay the only survival of the old Norse
spirit; and the Russians Tourgenieff and Tolstoy cast aside the
old mythology and told with minuteness the life of the peasant
and the serf. Everywhere there was a swing toward the wild
and unconventional, even toward the coarse and repulsive. The
effeminacy of early Tennysonianism, the cloying sweetness of
the mid-century annual, Keatsism, <i>Hyperionism</i>, Heineism, had
culminated in reaction. There was a craving for the acrid tang
of uncultivated things in borderlands and fields unsown.</p>

<p>In America had sprung up a group of humorists who had filled
the newspapers and magazines of the era with that masculine
laughter which was echoing along the Mississippi and the Ohio
and the gold camps of the Sierras. They were pioneers; they
were looking for incongruities and exaggerations, and quite by
accident they discovered a new American type, the Pike,&mdash;strange
creature to inspire a new literature.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>America has evolved four types, perhaps five, that are unique
"new birth of our new soil": the Yankee of the Hosea Biglow
and Sam Lawson variety; the frontiersman and scout exemplified
in Leather Stocking; the Southern "darky" as depicted by Russell,
Harris, Page, and others; the circuit rider of the frontier
period; and the Pike.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A Pike," says Bayard Taylor, "in the California dialect, is a native
of Missouri, Arkansas, Northern Texas, or Southern Illinois. The first
emigrants that came over the plains were from Pike County, Missouri;
but as the phrase, 'a Pike County man,' was altogether too long for
this short life of ours, it was soon abbreviated into 'a Pike.' Besides,
the emigrants from the aforementioned localities belonged evidently to
the same <i>genus</i>, and the epithet 'Western' was by no means sufficiently
descriptive.... He is the Anglo-Saxon relapsed into semi-barbarism.
He is long, lathy, and sallow; he expectorates vehemently; he takes
naturally to whisky; he has the 'shakes' his life long at home, though
he generally manages to get rid of them in California; he has little
respect for the rights of others; he distrusts men in 'store clothes,' but
venerates the memory of Andrew <span class="locked">Jackson."<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>Although he had not yet been named, the Pike had already
figured in American literature. George W. Harris had published
in 1867 <i>Sut Lovengood's Yarns</i>, a true piece of Pike literature;
Longstreet had drawn the type with fidelity in <i>Georgia
Scenes</i>, Baldwin's <i>Flush Times</i>, and the sketches of such ephemeral
writers as Madison Tensas, Sol Smith, T.&nbsp;W. Lane, T.&nbsp;A.
Burke, and J.&nbsp;L. McConnel, the author of <i>Western Characters</i>,
had drawn the first broad outlines. In all this work he was
simply the crude, uncouth Westerner, the antithesis of the man
of the East.</p>

<p>The first to discover him in his California phase and to affix
to him for the first time in any book of moment the name Pike
was "John Ph&oelig;nix" who in <i>Ph&oelig;nixiana</i> drew, as we have seen,
a sketch which has scarcely been improved upon by later writers.
It was not until 1871, however, that the name Pike and the
peculiar type denoted by the name became at all known to the
reading public.</p>

<p>The instant and enormous vogue of Pike literature came almost
by accident. Bret Harte late in the sixties had dashed off in a
happy moment a humorous account of an attempt made by two
California gamblers to fleece an innocent Chinaman who turned
out to be anything but innocent. He had entitled the poem
"Plain Language from Truthful James" and had thrown it
aside as a trifle. Some months later during the last exciting
moments before going to press with an edition of the <i>Overland
Monthly</i> it was discovered that the form was one page short.
There was nothing ready but this poem, and with misgivings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
Harte inserted it. The result was nothing less than amazing.
It proved to be the most notable page in the history of the magazine.
The poem captured the East completely; it was copied and
quoted and laughed at in every corner of the country. It swept
through England and beyond. <i>The Luck of Roaring Camp</i> and
the two or three strong pieces that followed it had given Harte
a certain vogue in the East, but now he swiftly became not only
a national, but an international figure. The fame of the
"Heathen Chinee," as the poem was now called, brought out of
obscurity other poems written by Harte during his editorial
days, among them "The Society upon the Stanislaus," and it
gave wings to other verses that he now wrote in the "Heathen
Chinee" meter and stanza&mdash;"Dow's Flat" and "Penelope."
Quickly there were added "Jim," "Chiquita," "In the Tunnel,"
and "Cicely," all of them dealing not with the "heathen Chinee"
of his first great strike, but with that other picturesque figure of
early California, the Pike.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">It was <i>gold</i>,&mdash;in the quartz,<br /></span>
<span class="i16">And it ran all alike;<br /></span>
<span class="i14">And I reckon five oughts<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And that house with the coopilow's his'n,&mdash;which the same isn't bad for a Pike.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>These poems with others were published in 1871 with the title
<i>East and West Poems</i>. The Pike County pieces in the volume
number altogether seven; John Hay's <i>Pike County Ballads</i>,
which came out in book form at almost the same moment, numbered
six&mdash;thirteen rather remarkable poems when one considers
the furore that they created and the vast influence they exerted
upon their times.</p>

<p>For a decade and more Pike County colored American literature.
In 1871 J.&nbsp;G. Holland summed up the situation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The "Pike" ... has produced a strange and startling sensation in
recent literature.... With great celerity he has darted through the
columns of our newspapers, the pages of our magazines, while quiet,
well-behaved contributors have stood one side and let him have his own
wild way. And it began to seem, at one time, as if the ordinary, decent
virtues of civilized society could stand no chance in comparison with
the picturesque heroism of this savage in <span class="locked">dialect.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
Much of Harte's fiction deals with this type. Save for Yuba
Bill, who was evidently a Northerner, the New Orleans gamblers
like Oakhurst and Jack Hamlin, and the Spanish and Mexican
natives, his characters were prevailingly Pikes. The dialect in all
of his work is dominated by this Southwestern element. In <i>The
New Assistant at the Pine Clearing School</i>, for instance, the
leader of the strike discourses like this: "We ain't hankerin'
much for grammar and dictionary hogwash, and we don't want
no Boston parts o' speech rung in on us the first thing in the
mo'nin'. We ain't Boston&mdash;We're Pike County&mdash;we are."
Tennessee's Partner was a Pike, and Uncle Jim and Uncle
Billy, and Kentuck and Sandy&mdash;glorified to be sure and transformed
by California and the society of the mines, but none the
less Pikes.</p>

<p>Following Harte and Hay came the outburst of local color
fiction. <i>The Hoosier Schoolmaster</i>, <i>Cape Cod Folks</i>, <i>Sam Lawson's
Fireside Stories</i>, <i>Hoosier Mosaics</i>, <i>Deephaven</i>, <i>Old Creole
Days</i>, <i>In the Tennessee Mountains</i> were but the beginning. For
two decades and more American fiction ran to the study of local
types and peculiar dialect. The movement was not confined to
prose. The Pike County balladry was continued by Sidney
Lanier and Irwin Russell with their songs and ballads of the
negro quarters, Will Carleton with his farm ballads, James Whitcomb
Riley with his Hoosier studies, Drummond with his tales of
the "Habitant" of the Canadian frontier, and by Eugene Field,
Sam Walter Foss, Holman F. Day, and scores of others down to
Robert W. Service, the depicter of the Yukon and the types of
the later gold rush.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Whether the Pike County balladry began with Bret Harte or
with John Hay, is a question at present unsettled. Mark Twain
was positive that Hay was the pioneer. His statement is important:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It was contemporaneously supposed," he wrote after Hay's death,
"that the <i>Pike County Ballads</i> were inspired or provoked by the Pike
County balladry of Bret Harte, and they were first accepted as imitations
or parodies. They were not written later, they were written
(and printed in newspapers) earlier. Mr. Hay told me this himself&mdash;in
1870 or '71, I should say. I believe&mdash;indeed, I am quite sure&mdash;that
he added that the newspapers referred to were obscure western back-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>woods
journals and that the ballads were not widely copied. Also he
said this: That by and by, when Harte's ballads began to sweep the
country, the noise woke his (Hay's) buried waifs and they rose and
<span class="locked">walked."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>To this testimony may be added Howells's belief that Hay's
ballads were prior to Harte's and that "a comparative study will
reveal their <span class="locked">priority,"<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></span> and the statement of W.&nbsp;E. Norris, a
schoolmate of the poet, that "the ballads appeared as fugitive
pieces in the newspapers, as I remember, and the attention they
attracted induced the author to compile them with others in
book <span class="locked">form."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>A comparative study of the poems certainly reveals the fact
that one set was influenced by the other. "Cicely" and "Little
Breeches" have very much in common. They are in the same
meter, and in one place they have practically identical lines:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>But I takes mine straight without sugar, and that's what's the matter
of me.&mdash;<i>Cicely.</i></p></blockquote>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I want a chaw of terbacker,<br /></span>

<div class="sigright">&mdash;<i>Jim Bludso.</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>It must be confessed that a study of the ballads and of the
other poetical works of the two poets leaves one with the impression
that Harte was first in the field. Hay's six Pike County
ballads stand isolated among his poems. Everything he wrote
before them and after them is in an utterly different key. One
feels as he reads him straight through&mdash;the earlier lyrics, <i>Castilian</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
<i>Days</i>, the later lyrics, <i>The Bread-winners</i>, <i>The Life of</i>
<i>Lincoln</i>&mdash;that these poems came from an impulse, that they
must have been thrown off in quick succession all at one time in
answer to some sudden impression. One feels, therefore, more
like trusting a contemporary biographical sketch than the unsupported
impressions of contemporaries thirty years after the
event. A sketch of John Hay, written by Clarence King in
April, 1874, records that when Hay returned from Spain in
1870</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All the world was reading Mr. Bret Harte's "Heathen Chinee" and
Mr. Hay did what all the world was doing.... He read all the poems,
but "Chiquita" and "Cicely," which gave him particular pleasure, puzzled
him and set him to thinking.... He saw how infinitely nobler
and better than nature they were, but, having been born and brought
up as a Pike himself, he saw that they were not nature. He wrote
"Little Breeches" for his own amusement&mdash;at least we have heard this
is his account of the matter&mdash;to see how a genuine Western feeling expressed
in genuine Western language, would impress Western people....
The ballads were written within a few days of each other: two
of them in a single <span class="locked">evening.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems all the more reasonable after we have considered
Hay's earlier poetic ideals. He had been born into a refined
home in the middle West, the son of a doctor and a New England
mother, and he had grown up amid books and intellectual ideals.
At the age of thirteen he had been sent to his uncle in Pike
County, Illinois, to attend a private school which proved to be
of such excellent quality that three years later he was prepared
to enter the Sophomore class at Brown. His life at Providence
awakened within him new ideals. He was invited into the literary
circle of the little city where he came to know Mrs. Whitman,
whose life at one time had touched that of Poe, and more
significant still, Nora Perry, the poet, a kindred soul. Graduating
at nineteen, the poet of his class, he went back to Warsaw,
the little Mississippi River town of his boyhood, dreaming the
dreams of a poet. But the outlook for the young dreamer was a
depressing one. "I am removed to a colder mental atmosphere,"
he wrote to Miss Perry. In the West, "I find only a dreary
waste of heartless materialism, where great and heroic qualities
may indeed bully their way up into the glare, but the flowers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
existence inevitably droop and <span class="locked">wither."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></span> He wrote much poetry
during this early period&mdash;translations of Heine, Longfellow-like
poems of beauty, and stirring lyrics to Miss Perry, who kept
alive his poetic dreams with letters and poems, among them her
"After the Ball" which she had shown him before it appeared
in the <i>Atlantic</i>. No Pike County notes in this period: he was
filled with the vision that even then was inspiring the little
transition school of poets struggling along the old paths: Stedman,
Stoddard, Aldrich, Hayne, Sill, and the others.</p>

<p>But there was no place in the young West for such dreams.
He burned much of the poetry he had written and set out sternly
to study law in his uncle's office. "I feel that Illinois and Rhode
Island are entirely antipathetic," he confessed to Miss Perry.
Within him he felt the fires even of genius, he wrote, "but when
you reflect how unsuitable such sentiments are to the busy life
of the Mississippi Valley, you may imagine then what an overhauling
I must receive&mdash;at my own hands too. There is, as yet,
no room in the West for a <span class="locked">genius."<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>No more poetry. He turned from it out of sheer sense of
duty and began with the law. But he was to be no lawyer. In
his uncle's office in Springfield he came into intimate contact
with Lincoln, and before his law studies had matured at all, he
found himself in Washington, the assistant secretary of the new
President. Poetry now was out of the question. The war took
his every moment, and after the war there was diplomatic
service abroad, at Paris, at Vienna, at Madrid. The literary
product of this latter period is as far from Pike work as
Rhode Island was from Illinois. One may find it in the section
of his poems headed "Wanderlieder"&mdash;beautiful lyrics of the
Longfellow type&mdash;"Sunrise in the Place de la Concorde," "The
Monks of Basle," "Ernst of Edelsheim," and the like. He
brought with him too when he returned in 1870 his Spanish
<i>Sketch Book</i>, <i>Castilian Days</i>, the work of a poet, golden atmosphered,
vivid, delightful. In the five years that followed on the
<i>Tribune</i> staff he wrote for the magazines his best poems. He was
a lyrist with a pen of gold, impassioned at times and impetuous:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span></p>

</div>
</div></div>

<p>Strange company indeed for the Pike County poems. Hay
himself was silent about the ballads; he seemed reluctant to talk
about them; in later days we know he viewed them with regret.</p>

<p>With Harte the problem is simpler. He wrote from the first
all varieties of humorous verse: broad farce like the "Ballad of
the Emeu" and the "California Madrigal"; rollicking parodies
like "The Tale of a Pony," "The Willows. After Edgar A.
Poe," and "The Lost Tails of Miletus"; extravaganzas like "The
Stage-Driver's Story" and "To the Pliocene Skull." His Pike
verses are in full accord with the greater part of all he wrote
both in verse and prose. They are precisely what we should
expect from the author of the California Pike tales. That he
was in one small part of his work an echo of Hay is exceedingly
unlikely. If the <i>Pike County Ballads</i> were, as Mark Twain
averred, first published in "obscure Western backwoods journals"
before "The Heathen Chinee" had appeared, the chances
that Harte saw them are so small that it is hardly worth taking
the time to consider them, especially when it is further averred
that they "were not widely copied." At present the advantage
is all with Harte; at present he may be hailed as the father of
the Pike balladry and so of the realistic school of poetry in
America. The question is not closed, however, nor will it be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
until the letters and journals of John Hay have been finally given
to the world.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>But even though the <i>Pike County Ballads</i> were not the first
in the field, even though they were suggested by Harte's work,
they were none the less valuable and influential. Hay wrote
them from full experience. They rang true at every point as
Harte's sometimes did not. Their author had lived from his
third until his thirteenth year in full view of the Mississippi
River; like Mark Twain he had played about the steamboat
wharf, picking up the river slang and hearing the rude stories
of the pilots and the deck hands. Warsaw, moreover, was on
the trail of the Western immigration, a place where all the
border types might be studied. Later, in Pittsfield, the county
seat of Pike County, he saw the Pike at home untouched by contact
with others&mdash;the Golyers, the Frys, the Shelbys, and all the
other drinkers of "whisky-skins."</p>

<p>Hay has painted a picture not only of a few highly individualized
types; he has drawn as well a background of conditions.
He has made permanent one brief phase of middle Western
history. It was this element of truth to nature&mdash;absolute realism&mdash;that
gave the poems their vogue and that assured them permanence.
Harte's ballads were read as something new and astonishing
and theatric; they created a sensation, but they did
not grip and convince. Hay's ballads were true to the heart
of Western life.</p>

<p>The new literature of the period was influenced more by the
<i>Pike County Ballads</i> than by the <i>East and West Poems</i>. The
ballads were something new in literature, something certainly
not Bostonian, certainly not English&mdash;something that could be
described only as "Western," fresh, independent, as the Pike
himself was new and independent among the types of humanity.
John Hay was therefore a pioneer, a creator, a leader. His was
one of those rare germinal minds that appear now and then to
break into new regions and to scatter seed from which others are
to reap the harvest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>In the same remarkable year in which appeared <i>East and
West Poems</i> and <i>Pike County Ballads</i> and so many other notable
first volumes, there began in <i>Hearth and Home</i> Edward Eggleston's
study of early Indiana life, entitled <i>The Hoosier Schoolmaster</i>.
Crude as the novel is in its plot and hasty as it is in
style and finish, it nevertheless must be numbered as the third
leading influence upon the literature of the period.</p>

<p>The extent to which it was influenced by Harte cannot be
determined. The brother and biographer of the novelist insists
that "the quickening influence that led to the writing of the
story" was the reading of Taine's <i>Art in the Netherlands</i>. He
further records that his brother one day said to him:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I am going to write a three-number story founded upon your experiences
at Ricker's Ridge, and call it <i>The Hoosier Schoolmaster</i>."
Then he set forth his theory of art&mdash;that the artist, whether with pen
or brush, who would do his best work, must choose his subjects from
the life that he knows. He cited the Dutch painters and justified his
choice of what seemed an unliterary theme, involving rude characters
and a strange dialect perversion, by reference to Lowell's success with
<i>The Biglow Papers</i>.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>If Eggleston was not influenced by Harte, then it is certain
that he drew his early inspiration from the same fountain head
as Harte did. Both were the literary offspring of Dickens. One
cannot read far in <i>The Hoosier Schoolmaster</i> without recognizing
the manner and spirit of the elder novelist. It is more prominent
in his earlier work&mdash;in the short story, <i>The Christmas Club</i>,
which is almost a parody, in the portraits of Shockey and Hawkins
and Miranda Means, and in the occasional moralizing and
goody-goodiness of tone.</p>

<p>There are few novelists, however, who contain fewer echoes
than Eggleston. He was a more original and more accurate
writer than Harte. We can trust his backgrounds and his picture
of society implicitly at every point. Harte had saturated
himself with the fiction of other men; he had made himself an
artist through long study of the masters, and he looked at his
material always with the eye of an artist. He selected most
carefully his viewpoint, his picturesque details, his lights and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
shadows, and then made his sketch. Eggleston, on the other
hand, had made no study of his art. He had read almost no
novels, for, as he expressed it, he was "bred 'after the straitest
sect of our religion' a Methodist." All he knew of plot construction
he had learned from reading the Greek tragedies.</p>

<p>His weakness was his strength. He silenced his conscience,
which rebelled against novels, by resolving to write not fiction
but truth. He would make a sketch of life as it actually had
been lived in Indiana in his boyhood, a sketch that should be as
minute in detail and as remorselessly true as a Millet painting.
It was not to be a novel; it was to be history. "No man is
worthy," he declared in the preface to <i>The Circuit Rider</i>, "to be
called a novelist who does not endeavor with his whole soul to
produce the higher form of history, by writing truly of men as
they are, and dispassionately of those forms of life that come
within his scope."</p>

<p>When Eggleston, later in his life, abandoned fiction to become
a historian, there was no break in his work. He had always been
a historian. Unlike Harte, he had embodied in his novels only
those things that had been a part of his own life; he had written
with loving recollection; he had recorded nothing that was not
true. He had sought, moreover, to make his novels an interpretation
of social conditions as he had known them and studied
them. "What distinguishes them [his novels]," he once wrote,
"from other works of fiction is the prominence which they give
to social conditions; that the individual characters are here
treated to a greater degree than elsewhere as parts of a study
of society&mdash;as in some sense the logical result of the <span class="locked">environment."<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Novels like <i>The End of the World</i> and <i>The Circuit Rider</i> are
in reality chapters in the history of the American people. They
are realistic studies, by one to the manner born, of an era in our
national life that has vanished forever.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Edward Eggleston was born in Vevay, Indiana, December 10,
1837. His father, a member of an old Virginia family, after
a brilliant course at William and Mary College, had migrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
westward, settled in Indiana, and just as he was making himself
a notable figure in the law and the politics of his State, had
died when his eldest son, Edward, was but nine years old. The
son had inherited both his father's intellectual brilliancy and his
frail physique. Though eager for knowledge, he was able all
through his boyhood to attend school but little, and, though his
father had provided for a college scholarship, the son never
found himself able to take advantage of it. He was largely self-educated.
He studied whenever he could, and by making use
of all his opportunities he was able before he was twenty to
master by himself nearly all of the branches required for a college
degree.</p>

<p>His boyhood was a wandering one. After the death of his
father, the family removed to New Albany and later to Madison.
At the age of thirteen he was sent to southern Indiana to live
with an uncle, a large landowner, and it was here in the lowlands
of Decatur County that he had his first chance to study those
primitive Hoosier types that later he was to make permanent in
literature. Still later he lived for a year and a half with his
father's people in Virginia.</p>

<p>Before he was nineteen he had chosen his profession. The
tense Methodist atmosphere in which he had been reared had
had its effect. He would be a preacher, a circuit rider, one of
those tireless latter-day apostles that had formed so picturesque
a part of his boyhood. "How did he get his theological education?
It used to be said that Methodist preachers were educated
by the old ones telling the young ones all they knew; but besides
this oral instruction [he] carried in his saddle bags John Wesley's
simple, solid sermons, Charles Wesley's hymns, and a
<span class="locked">Bible."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Eggleston's saddle bags contained far more than these. He
read Whitfield and Thomas à Kempis, the <i>&OElig;dipus Tyrannus</i> in
the Greek, and all the history and biography that he could buy
or borrow. His "appointment" was in southeastern Indiana, a
four-weeks' circuit with ten preaching places far apart in the
Ohio River bottoms with their scattering population of malarial
Pikes and their rude border civilization. He began his work
with enthusiasm. He lived with his people; he entered intimately
into their affairs; he studied at first hand their habits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
life and of thought. It was an ideal preparation for a novelist,
but the rough life was in no way fitted for his frail physique.
After six months he broke down almost completely and was sent
into the pine forests of Minnesota to recuperate. For several
years he was connected with the Minnesota conference. He held
pastorates in St. Paul and other places, but his health still continuing
precarious, he at length retired to Chicago as an editor
of the <i>Little Corporal</i>, a juvenile paper later merged in <i>St.
Nicholas</i>. This step turned his attention to literature as a profession.
From Chicago he was called to Brooklyn to the staff of
the <i>Independent</i>, of which he later became the editor, and the
rest of his life, save for a five years' pastorate in Brooklyn, he
devoted to literature.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The Western novels of Edward Eggleston are seven in number.
One of them, <i>The Mystery of Metropolisville</i>, deals with
frontier life in Minnesota, a stirring picture of a vital era; all the
others are laid in Indiana or eastern Ohio in that malarial, river-bottom,
Pike area that had been familiar to his boyhood. Two
of them are historical novels: <i>The Circuit Rider</i>, which deals
with Indiana life during the early years of the century before the
War of 1812, and <i>The Graysons</i>, a stirring tale involving Abraham
Lincoln, who had lived in the State from 1816 to 1830. <i>The
End of the World</i> described the Millerite excitement of Eggleston's
early boyhood; the others, <i>The Hoosier Schoolmaster</i>, <i>Roxy</i>,
and <i>The Hoosier Schoolboy</i>, were studies of sections of life that
he had known intimately. One other novel he wrote, <i>The Faith
Doctor</i>, the scene of which is laid in New York, and many short
stories and juveniles.</p>

<p>The atmosphere and the characters of these Western stories
strike us as strangely unreal and exaggerated to-day. In his short
story, <i>The Gunpowder Plot</i>, Eggleston complained that "whenever
one writes with photographic exactness of frontier life he
is accused of inventing improbable things." It seems indeed
like a world peopled by Dickens, these strange phantasmagoria,
"these sharp contrasts of corn-shuckings and camp-meetings, of
wild revels followed by wild revivals; these contrasts of highwayman
and preacher; this <i>mélange</i> of picturesque simplicity,
grotesque humor, and savage ferocity, of abandoned wickedness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
and austere <span class="locked">piety."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></span> But grotesque and unreal as it is, it is
nevertheless a true picture of the West in which Lincoln spent
his boyhood. Every detail and every personage in all the novels
had an exact counterpart somewhere in that stirring era.</p>

<p>The novelist, however, is not content with a mere graphic
picture. He is a philosopher. <i>The Circuit Rider</i>, for instance,
the most valuable study in the series, brings home to the reader
the truth of the author's dictum that "Methodism was to the
West what Puritanism was to New England." "In a true picture
of this life," he adds, "neither the Indian nor the hunter
is the center-piece, but the circuit rider. More than any one else,
the early circuit preachers brought order out of this chaos. In
no other class was the real heroic element so finely displayed."</p>

<p>The figure of the circuit rider as he strides through the book,
thundering the "Old Homeric epithets of early Methodism, exploding
them like bomb-shells&mdash;'you are hair-hung and breeze-shaken
over hell,'" has almost an epic quality. "Magruder was
a short stout man, with wide shoulders, powerful arms, shaggy
brows, and bristling black hair. He read the hymns two lines
at a time, and led the singing himself. He prayed with the
utmost sincerity, but in a voice that shook the cabin windows and
gave the simple people a deeper reverence for the dreadfulness
of the preacher's message."</p>

<p>It was his business to preach once or twice a day and three
times on the Sabbath in a parish that had no western bounds.
He talked of nothing but of sin and wrath and judgment to come.
His arrival in the settlement cast over everything an atmosphere
of awe. He aroused violent antagonisms. The rough element
banded together to destroy his influence. They threatened him
with death if he entered certain territory, but he never hesitated.
He could fight as well as he could pray. They would
fall broken and bruised before his savage onslaught and later
fall in agony of repentance before his fiery preaching. His sermons
came winged with power.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He hit right and left. The excitable crowd swayed with consternation,
as in a rapid and vehement utterance, he denounced their sins,
with the particularity of one who had been familiar with them all his
life.... Slowly the people pressed forward off the fences. All at
once there was a loud bellowing cry from some one who had fallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
prostrate outside the fence, and who began to cry aloud as if the portals
of an endless perdition were yawning in his face.... This outburst
of agony was fuel to the flames, and the excitement now spread
to all parts of the audience.... Captain Lumsden ... started for
his horse and was seized with that curious nervous affection which
originated in these religious excitements and disappeared with them.
He jerked violently&mdash;his jerking only adding to his excitement.</p></blockquote>

<p>Eggleston has caught with vividness the spirit of this heroic
age and brought it to us so that it actually lives again. The
members of the conference at Hickory Ridge have gathered to
hear the bishop read the appointments for the year:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The brethren, still in sublime ignorance of their destiny, sang fervently
that fiery hymn of Charles Wesley's:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Jesus, the name high over all,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In hell or earth or sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Angels and men before him fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And devils fear and fly.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">And when they reached the last stanzas there was the ring of soldiers
ready for battle in their martial voices. That some of them would die
from exposure, malaria, or accident during the next year was probable.
Tears came to their eyes, and they involuntarily began to grasp
the hands of those who stood next to them as they approached the
climax of the hymn....</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Happy if with my latest breath<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I may but gasp His name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Preach Him to all, and cry in death,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Behold, behold the Lamb!"<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">Then, with suffused eyes, they resumed their seats, and the venerable
Asbury, with calmness and a voice faltering with age, made them a
brief address:</p>

<p>"General Wolfe," said the British Admiralty, "will you go and take
Quebec?" "I'll do it or die," he replied. Here the bishop paused,
looked round about upon them, and added, with a voice full of emotion,
"He went and did both. We send you first to take the country
allotted to you. We want only men who are determined to do it or die!
Some of you, dear brethren, will do both. If you fall, let us hear that
you fell like Methodist preachers at your post, face to the foe, and the
shout of victory on your lips!"</p>

<p>The effect of this speech was beyond description. There were sobs,
and cries of "Amen," "God grant it," "Hallelujah!" from every part
of the old log church. Every man was ready for the hardest place, if
he must.</p></blockquote>

<p>With the circuit rider Eggleston undoubtedly added another
type to the gallery of American fiction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>The novels of Eggleston have not the compression, the finish,
the finesse of Harte's. Some of his works, notably <i>The Hoosier
Schoolmaster</i>, were written at full speed with the press clattering
behind the author. Often there is to the style a mawkish
Sunday-school juvenile flavor. There is often a lack of art, of
distinction, of constructive skill. But there are compensations
even for such grave defects. There is a vividness of characterization
and of description that can be compared even with that of
Dickens; there is the ability to sketch a scene that clings to the
memory in all its details. The trial scene in <i>The Graysons</i> is not
surpassed for vividness and narrative power in any novel of the
period. And, finally, there is a realism in background and atmosphere
that makes the novels real sources of history.</p>

<p>The influence of Eggleston's work was enormous. He helped
to create a new reading public, a public made up of those who,
like himself, had had scruples against novel reading. He was an
influence in the creating of a new and healthy realism in America.
What Hay was to the new school of local color poets, Eggleston
was to the new school of novelists. Harte was a romanticist;
Eggleston was a realist. From Harte came the first conception
of a new and powerful literature of the West. Eggleston was
the directing hand that turned the current of this new literature
into the channel of realism.</p>

<span class="subhead">JOAQUIN MILLER</span></h2>

<p>The work of Harte and even of Hay is the work of an onlooker
rather than a sharer. One feels that both were studying
their picturesque surroundings objectively for the sake of
"copy"; but Joaquin Miller, like Mark Twain, may be said to
have emerged from the materials he worked in. He could write
in his later years, "My poems are literally my autobiography."
"If you care to read further of my life, making allowance for
poetic license, you will find these [poems] literally true." In
some ways he is a more significant figure than either Harte or
Hay. No American writer, not even Thoreau or Whitman, has
ever been more uniquely individual, and none, not even Mark
Twain, has woven into his writings more things that are
peculiarly American, or has worked with a more thorough first-hand
knowledge of the picturesque elements that went into the
making of the new West. He is the poet of the American westward
march, the poet of "the great American desert," the poet
preëminently of the mountain ranges from Alaska to Nicaragua
as John Muir is their prose interpreter.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>The life of Miller is a series of foot-notes to his poems. He
was born on the line of the westward march. In the valuable
autobiographical preface to the Bear edition of his poems he
writes: "My cradle was a covered wagon, pointed west. I was
born in a covered wagon, I am told, at or about the time it crossed
the line dividing Indiana from Ohio." That was in 1841, and
the name given him was Cincinnatus Hiner Miller. His parents,
like those of Mark Twain, were of that restless generation that
could abide nowhere long, but must press ever on and on westward.
His mother's people had migrated from the Yadkin River
country in North Carolina with the Boones, "devoted Quakers in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
search of a newer land"; his grandfather Miller was a Scotchman,
a restless pioneer who had fallen at Fort Meigs, leaving a
family of small children to come up as they could in the wilderness.
One of them, the father of the poet, picked up in a varied
career along the border certain elements of book learning that
enabled him to teach school in the settlement towns of Ohio and
Indiana.</p>

<p>The boy's earliest memories were of the frontier with its land
clearing, its Indian neighbors, and its primitive hardships.
Schooling he received at the hands of his father. The first book
that he could remember was Frémont's <i>Explorations</i>, read aloud
to the family by the father until all knew it literally by heart,
maps and all. Lured by its enthusiastic descriptions and by reports
of a former pupil who had gone to Oregon and by the new
act of Congress which gave to every homesteader six hundred and
forty acres of land free, on March 17, 1852, with "two big heavily
laden wagons, with eight yoke of oxen to each, a carriage and two
horses for mother and baby sister, and a single horse for the three
boys to ride," the family set out across the wild continent of
America. "The distance," he records, "counting the contours
of often roundabout ways, was quite, or nearly, three thousand
miles. The time was seven months and five days. There were
no bridges, no railroad levels, nothing of the sort. We had only
the road as nature had made it. Many times, at night, after
ascending a stream to find a ford, we could look back and see
our smoldering camp-fires of the day before."</p>

<p>That heroic journey into the unknown West with its awful
dangers, its romantic strangeness, its patriarchal conditions, its
constant demand for self-dependence, made an indelible impress
on the young lad. It was a journey of Argonauts, one of the
thousands of journeys that made picturesque a whole epoch. He
has described it in some of the most stirring of his poems. All
through his poetry occur stanzas like this:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What strength! what strife! what rude unrest!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What shocks! what half-shaped armies met!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mighty nation moving West,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all its steely sinews set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the living forests. Hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shouts, the shots of pioneer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rending forests, rolling wheels,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if some half-checked army reels,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Recoils, redoubles, comes again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loud-sounding like a hurricane.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">He has described it too in prose that is really stirring. His dedicatory
preface to <i>The Ship in the Desert</i>, London, 1876, is a poem
of the Whitman order. Note a stanza like this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>How dark and deep, how sullen, strong and lionlike the mighty
Missouri rolled between his walls of untracked wood and cleft the unknown
domain of the middle world before us! Then the frail and
buffeted rafts on the river, the women and children huddled together,
the shouts of the brawny men as they swam with the bellowing cattle,
the cows in the stormy stream eddying, whirling, spinning about, calling
to their young, their bright horns shining in the sun. The wild
men waiting on the other side; painted savages, leaning on their bows,
despising our weakness, opening a way, letting us pass on to the unknown
distances, where they said the sun and moon lay down together
and brought forth the stars. The long and winding lines of wagons,
the graves by the wayside, the women weeping together as they passed
on. Then hills, then plains, parched lands like Syria, dust and alkali,
cold streams with woods, camps by night, great wood fires in circles,
tents in the center like Cæsar's battle camps, painted men that passed
like shadows, showers of arrows, the wild beasts howling from the hills.</p></blockquote>

<p>Two years with his parents on the new Oregon farm, and the
lad ran away to the mines. "Go, I must. The wheels of the
covered wagon in which I had been born were whirling and
whirling, and I must be off." For a time he was cook in a
mining camp, but it was work impossible for a boy of thirteen,
and soon he was on his wanderings again, first with one Ream,
an adventurer, then with Mountain Joe, a trader in half-wild
horses. He was drawn into Gibson's fight with the Modocs, was
wounded frightfully by an arrow that pierced close to the base
of the brain, and later was nursed back to life by a squaw who
had adopted him in place of her son who had fallen in the battle.
"When the spring came and Mount Shasta stood out white and
glorious above the clouds, I hailed him as a brother." And again
he stole away and joined another band of Indians. "When the
Modocs arose one night and massacred eighteen men, every man
in the Pit River Valley, I alone was spared and spared only because
I was <i>Los bobo</i>, the fool. Then more battles and two more
wounds." For a long time his mind was like that of a child.
The Indians indeed, as he records, treated him "as if [he] had
been newly born to their tribe."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Soon I was stronger, body and soul. The women gave me gold&mdash;from
whence?&mdash;and I being a "renegade," descended to San Francisco
and set sail for Boston, but stopped at Nicaragua with Walker. Thence
up the coast to Oregon, when strong enough. I went home, went to
college some, taught school some, studied law at home some; but ever
and ever the lure of the mountains called and called, and I could not
keep my mind on my books. But I could keep my mind on the perils
I had passed. I could write of them, and I did write of them, almost
every day. <i>The Tale of the Tall Alcalde</i>, <i>Oregonian</i>, <i>Californian</i>, <i>With
Walker in Nicaragua</i>&mdash;I had lived all these and more; and they were
now a part of my existence.... Meantime I was admitted to the bar.
Then came the discovery of gold in Idaho, Montana, and so on, and
I was off like a rocket with the rest.</p></blockquote>

<p>To call Miller illiterate, as many, especially in printing offices
which have handled his copy, have done, is hardly fair. His
father, it must be remembered, was a schoolmaster with the
Scotch reverence for serious books and for education, and the
boy's early schooling was not neglected. To say, on the other
hand, as many, including the poet himself, have said, that he
received a college education, is also to speak without knowledge.
He did complete a course in Columbia University, Eugene,
Oregon, in 1859, but it was an institution in no way connected
with the present University of Oregon. It was, rather, a mission
school maintained by the Methodist Church South, and, according
to Professor Herbert C. Howe of the University of Oregon, "its
instruction was, at its utmost stretch, not enough to carry its
pupils through the first half of a high school course, and most
of its pupils were of grammar grade." It was closed suddenly
early in the Civil-War period because of the active Southern
sympathies of its president, who was himself very nearly the
whole "university." It is significant that at almost the same
time the Eugene <i>Democratic Register</i> edited by Miller was suppressed
for alleged disloyalty to the Union.</p>

<p>For a period the poet undoubtedly did apply himself with
diligence to books. Of his fellow students at Eugene he has recorded,
"I have never since found such determined students
and omnivorous readers. We had all the books and none of the
follies of the great centers." The mania for writing had seized
him early. Assisted by his father, he had recorded the events
of his trip across the plains in a journal afterwards burned with
his parental home in Oregon. "The first thing of mine in print
was the valedictory class poem, 'Columbia College.'" Undoubtedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
during this period he read widely and eagerly. "My two
brothers and my sister were by my side, our home with our parents,
and we lived entirely to ourselves, and really often made
ourselves ill from too much study. We were all school teachers
when not at college."</p>

<p>Living away from the centers of culture, with books as exotic
things that came from without, almost as from another world,
Miller, like many another isolated soul, grew to maturity with the
feeling that something holy lay about the creation of literature
and that authors, especially poets, were beings apart from the
rest of men. Poetry became to him more than an art: it became
a religion. "Poetry," he declared in his first London preface,
"is with me a passion which defies reason." It was an honest
declaration. During the sixties as express messenger in the
Idaho gold fields, as newspaper editor, and judge, he wrote verse
continually&mdash;"I lived among the stars"&mdash;but he preserved of
all he wrote only a few rather colorless pieces which he published
in 1868 with the title <i>Specimens</i>. The next year he issued at
Portland, Oregon, <i>Joaquin et al</i>, a book of one hundred and
twenty-four pages. It was his salute to the literary world. He
addressed it "To the Bards of San Francisco Bay," and his
address sheds light upon the timid young poet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I am as one unlearned, uncouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From country come to join the youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some sweet town in quest of truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A skilless Northern Nazarine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From whence no good can ever come.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I stand apart as one that's dumb:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hope, I fear, I hasten home,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I plunge into my wilds again.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">He followed his book down to what was to him the glorious city
of art and of soul that would welcome him with rapture, for
was he too not a bard? Says Charles W. Stoddard, "Never had
a breezier bit of human nature dawned upon me this side of the
South Seas than that poet of the Sierra when he came to San
Francisco in 1870."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>But the great Western city, as did New York a few months
later, went on totally unaware of his advent. The bards even
of San Francisco Bay did not come to the borders of the town to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
welcome the new genius. They seemed unaware of his presence.
Harte was inclined to be sarcastic, but finally allowed the
<i>Overland Monthly</i> to say a word of faint praise for the young
poet, despite what it termed his "pawing and curvetting." "His
passion," it declared in a review written probably by Ina Coolbrith,
"is truthful and his figures flow rather from his perception
than his sentiment." But that was all. He considered
himself persecuted. His associates in the law had made fun of
the legal term in the title of his book, had hailed him as "Joaquin"
Miller, and had treated him as a joke. "I was so unpopular
that when I asked a place on the Supreme Bench at the
Convention, I was derisively told: 'Better stick to poetry.'
Three months later, September 1, 1870, I was kneeling at the
grave of Burns. I really expected to die there in the land of
my fathers." He would support himself as Irving had supported
himself with his pen. He sought cheap quarters in the
great city and began to write. February 1, 1871, he recorded
in his diary: "I have nearly given up this journal to get out
a book. I wanted to publish a great drama called 'Oregonian,'
but finally wrote an easy-going little thing which I called 'Arazonian,'
and put the two together and called the little book
<i>Pacific Poems</i>. It has been ready for the printer a long time."</p>

<p>He took the manuscript from publisher to publisher until,
as he declares, every house in London had rejected it. His reception
by Murray shows the general estimate of poetry by London
publishers in the early seventies:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He held his head to one side, flipped the leaves, looked in, jerked
his head back, looked in again, twisted his head like a giraffe, and
then lifted his long finger:</p>

<p>"Aye, now, don't you know poetry won't do? Poetry won't do,
don't you know?"</p>

<p>"But will you not read it, please?"</p>

<p>"No, no, no. No use, no use, don't you know?"</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Then in desperation he printed a part of it at his own expense
under the title <i>Pacific Poems</i> and sent out copies broadcast to
the press. Never was venture so unpromising crowned with results
so startling. The little book was hailed everywhere as
something remarkable. The <i>St. James Gazette</i> declared that
the poem "Arazonian"&mdash;that was Miller's early spelling of the
word&mdash;was by Browning. The new author was traced to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
miserable lodgings and made a lion of, and before the year was
over the whole original manuscript of <i>Pacific Poems</i> had been
brought out in a beautiful edition with the title <i>Songs of the
Sierras</i>. Its author's real name did not appear upon the title
page. The poems were by "Joaquin Miller," a name destined
completely to supersede the more legal patronymic. "The third
poem in my first London book," he explains, "was called 'California,'
but it was called 'Joaquin' in the Oregon book. And
it was from this that I was, in derision, called 'Joaquin.' I
kept the name and the poem, too, till both were at least <span class="locked">respected."<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Few American books have been received by the English press,
or any press for that matter, with such unanimous enthusiasm.
Miller was the literary discovery of the year. The <i>London
Times</i> declared the book the "most remarkable utterance America
has yet given"; the <i>Evening Standard</i> called it poetry "the
most original and powerful." The pre-Raphaelite brotherhood
counted its author as one of their own number, and gave him a
dinner. Browning hailed him as an equal, and the press everywhere
celebrated him as "the Oregon Byron." The reason for
it all can be explained best, perhaps, in words that W.&nbsp;M. Rossetti
used in his long review of the poet in the <i>London Academy</i>:
"Picturesque things picturesquely put ... indicating strange,
outlandish, and romantic experiences." The same words might
have been used by a reviewer of Byron's first Eastern romance
on that earlier morning when he too had awakened to find himself
famous. The book, moreover, was felt to be the promise of
stronger things to come. "It is a book," continued Rossetti,
"through whose veins the blood pulsates with an abounding rush,
while gorgeous subtropical suns, resplendent moons, and abashing
majesties of mountain form ring round the gladiatorial human
life."</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Of Miller's subsequent career, his picturesque travels, his
log cabin life in Washington, D.&nbsp;C., his Klondike experiences
and the like, it is not necessary to speak. There was always an
element of the sensational about his doings and his equipment.
To the majority of men he was a <i>poseur</i> and even a mountebank.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
At times indeed it was hard for even his friends to take him
with seriousness. How was one, for instance, to approach in serious
mood <i>As It Was in the Beginning</i>, 1903, a book twelve inches
by five, printed on coarse manila wrapping stock, bound in thin
yellow paper, and having on the cover an enormous stork holding
in his bill President Roosevelt as an infant? Those who
were closest to him, however, are unanimous in declaring that all
this eccentricity was but the man himself, the expression of his
own peculiar individuality, and that he was great enough to rise
above the conventionalities of life and be himself. C.&nbsp;W. Stoddard,
who of all men, perhaps, knew him most intimately in his
earlier period, maintained that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>People who knew him wondered but little at his pose, his Spanish
mantle and sombrero, his fits of abstraction or absorption, his old-school
courtly air in the presence of women&mdash;even the humblest of the
sex. He was thought eccentric to the last degree, a bundle of affectations,
a crank&mdash;even a freak. Now I who have known Joaquin Miller
as intimately as any man could know him, know that these mannerisms
are natural to him; they have developed naturally; they are his second
<span class="locked">nature.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Hamlin Garland, Charles F. Lummis, and many others who
have known the poet intimately have spoken in the same way.
His mannerisms and his eccentric point of view arose from the
isolation in which his formative years were passed, his ignorance
of life, his long association with highly individualized men in the
mines and the camps and the mountains, and his intimate knowledge
of the picturesque Spanish life of Mexico and Central
America. His education had been peculiar, even unique. "All
that I am," he declares in <i>My Own Story</i>,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> "or ever hope to be
I owe them [the Indians]. I owe no white man anything at all."
He had never been a boy, he was utterly without sense of humor,
and he had a native temperament aside from all this, that was
all his own&mdash;need we say more?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>When one approaches the poetry of Joaquin Miller, one is at
first confused by the lavishness of it, the strength, and then
swiftly the dreary weakness of it. It is like his own landscapes,
abounding in vast barrens and flats, with here and there glimpses
of glittering peaks and vast ranges, and now and then oases
full of marvelous revel of color and strange birds and tropic
flowers. Three-fourths of all he wrote is lifeless and worthless,
but the other quarter is to American poetry what the Rockies
are to the American landscape. Few poets have so needed an
editor with courage to reject and judgment to arrange. Miller
himself has edited his poems with barbarous savageness. He has
not hesitated to lop off entire cantos, to butcher out the whole
trunk of a poem, leaving only straggling and unrelated branches,
to add to work in his early manner stanzas after his later ideals,
and to revamp and destroy and cast utterly away after a fashion
that has few precedents. He has done the work with a broad-ax
when a lancet was needed. His editings are valuable, indeed,
only in the new prose matter that he has added as foot-note and
introduction.</p>

<p>The key to Miller's poetry is an aphorism from his own pen:
"We must, in some sort, live what we write if what we write is
to live." The parts of his work that undoubtedly will live are
those poems that deal most closely with the material from which
he sprang and of which his early life was molded. He is the
poet of the frontier and of the great mid-century exodus across
the Plains. Poems like "The Heroes of Oregon," and "Exodus
for Oregon," are a part of the national history. They thrill at
every point with reality and life.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Plains! the shouting drivers at the wheel;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crash of leather whips; the crush and roll<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wheels; the groan of yokes and grinding steel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And iron chain, and lo! at last the whole<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vast line, that reach'd as if to touch the goal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Began to stretch and stream away and wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toward the west, as if with one control;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then hope loom'd fair, and home lay far behind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before, the boundless plain, and fiercest of their kind.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">And again</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then dust arose, a long dim line like smoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From out of riven earth. The wheels went groaning by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ten thousand feet in harness and in yoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They tore the ways of ashen alkali,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And desert winds blew sudden, swift and dry.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dust! it sat upon and fill'd the train!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seemed to fret and fill the very sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo! dust upon the beasts, the tent, the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dust, alas! on breasts that rose not up again.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">Pictures of the Plains, the Indian camp, the mine, the mountain,
the herd, the trail, are to be found scattered everywhere in his
work. One finds them in the most unlikely places&mdash;diamonds
embedded often in whole acres of clay. In so unpromising a
book as <i>As It Was in the Beginning</i> with its grotesque introduction
explaining in characteristic mixed metaphor that "When,
like a sentinel on his watch tower, the President, with his divine
audacity and San Juan valor, voiced the real heart of the Americans
against 'race suicide,' I hastened to do my part, in my
own way, ill or well, in holding up his hands on the firing line"&mdash;even
in this book one finds sudden flashes of truest poetry.
He is describing winter on the Yukon. About him are an
eager band of gold-seekers ready to press north:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The siege of Troy knew scarce such men;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cowards had not voyaged then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The weak had died upon the way.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">He describes with realism the horrors and the beauties of the
Arctic night, then at last the rising of the sun after the long
darkness:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then glad earth shook her raiment wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As some proud woman satisfied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tiptoed exultant, till her form,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A queen above some battle storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blazed with the glory, the delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of battle with the hosts of night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And night was broken, light at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay on the Yukon. Night had past.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">In passages like these the imagination of the poet breaks out for
a moment like the moon from dark clouds, but all too often
it is <i>only</i> for a moment.</p>

<p>He is the poet preëminently of the mountains of the Northwest.
The spell of them was on him as it was on John Muir.
At times in their presence he bursts into the very ecstasy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
poetry; sonorous rhapsodies and invocations in which he reaches
his greatest heights:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sierras, and eternal tents<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of snow that flash o'er battlements<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mountains! My land of the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Am I not true? have I not done<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All things for thine, for thee alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O sun-land, sea-land thou mine own?<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">There is a sweep and vastness about him at his best that one
finds in no other American poet. No cameo cutting for him, no
little panels, no parlor decorations and friezes. His canvas is
all out of doors and as broad as the continent itself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, heart of the world's heart! West! my West!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look up! look out! There are fields of kine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are clover-fields that are red as wine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a world of kine in the fields take rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ruminate in the shade of the trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That are white with blossoms or brown with bees.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are emerald seas of corn and cane;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are cotton fields like a foamy main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the far-off South where the sun was born.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">The wild freedom of the Western air beats and surges in his
lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Room! room to turn round in, to breathe and be free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To grow to be giant, to sail as at sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the speed of the wind on a steed with his mane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the wind, without pathway or route or a rein.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Room! room to be free where the white border'd sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blows a kiss to a brother as boundless as he;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the buffalo come like a cloud on the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pouring on like the tide of a storm-driven main,<br /></span>

<p class="in0">In his enthusiasm for the mountains and the American landscape
Miller was thoroughly sincere. Despite all his posturing
and his fantastic costumes he was a truly great soul, and he spoke
from his heart when he said in 1909: "But pity, pity, that
men should so foolishly waste time with either me or mine when
I have led them to the mighty heart of majestic Shasta. Why
yonder, lone as God and white as the great white throne, there
looms against the sapphire upper seas a mountain peak that
props the very porch of heaven; and yet they bother with and
want to torment a poor mote of dust that sinks in the grasses at
their <span class="locked">feet."<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></span></p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>This leads us to the second phase of Miller's personality: he
was a philosopher, a ponderer upon the deeper things of the spirit.
He had inherited with his Scotch blood a religious strain, and a
large section of his poetry deals with regions far indeed from
his Sierras. He has written much upon the common fundamentals
of humanity: religion, love, honor, courage, truth, and
the like. In his "Vale! America," written in Italy during his
second European sojourn, he could say,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<span class="i0">It seems to me that I then could sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sing as never sung man before.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>There was within him indeed something of the recluse and the
hermit. No one of the period, not even Muir or Burroughs, approached
Nature with more of worship. He would live with her
and make her central in every point of his life. In his later
years he built him a cabin on the heights above San Francisco
Bay with a tremendous outlook of sea and mountain and sky, and
lived there the rest of his life.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I know a grassy slope above the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The utmost limit of the westmost land.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In guard, with mailed limb and lifted hand,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And peace, eternal peace, possesses, wild and wide.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>He became more and more solitary, more and more of a mystic
as the years went on. Even from the first, as Rossetti pointed
out, there is an almost oriental pantheism in him. It came perhaps
from his Indian training. "Some curious specimens,"
Rossetti observed, "might be culled of the fervid interfusion of
external nature and the human soul in his descriptive passages.
The great factors of the natural world&mdash;the sea, the mountains,
the sun, moon, and stars&mdash;become personalities, animated with
an intense life and dominant possession."</p>

<p>But Miller was by no means a satyr, as many have pictured
him, delighting in wildness for the mere sake of wildness. He
overflowed with humanity. No man was ever more sensitive or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
more genuinely sympathetic. In his later years he sat above
the tumult a prophet and seer, and commented and advised
and warned. Great areas of his poetry have nothing to do with
the West, nothing at all with the manner and the material that
are so naturally associated with his name. For decades his voice
was heard wherever there was oppression or national wrong.
He wrote sonorous lyrics for the Indians, the Boers, the Russian
Jews; he wrote the ringing "Cuba Libre" which was read by
the Baroness de Bazus in the leading American cities before the
Spanish war; he championed the cause of woman; and everywhere
he took the side of the weaker against the strong. In this
he resembles Mark Twain, that other prophet of the era. The
freedom of the new West was in both of them, the true American
"hatred of tyranny intense." He was won always by gentleness
and beauty: he wrote a <i>Life of Christ</i>, he wrote <i>The City Beautiful</i>,
and <i>Songs of the Soul</i>.</p>

<p>But almost all that he wrote in this pet field of his endeavor
perished with its day. Of it all there is no single poem that
may be called distinctive. He moralizes, he preaches, he champions
the weak, but he says nothing new, nothing compelling.
He is not a singer of the soul: he is the maker of resounding
addresses to the peaks and the plains and the sea; the poet of
the westward march of a people; the poet of elemental men in
elemental surroundings&mdash;pioneers amid the vastness of the uttermost
West.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>It is easy to find defects in Miller's work. Even the sophomore
can point out his indebtedness to Byron and to <span class="locked">Swinburne&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The wine-dark wave with its foam of wool&mdash;<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">his Byronic heroes and overdrawn heroines; his diction excessive
in alliteration and adjectives; his barbarous profusion of color;
his overworking of the word "tawney"; his inability to tell a
story; his wordiness and ramblings; his lack of distinctness and
dramatic power. One sweeps away the whole of this, however,
when one admits that three quarters of all that Miller wrote
should be thrown away before criticism begins.</p>

<p>The very faults of the poet serve as arguments that he <i>was</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
a poet&mdash;a poet born, not a poet made from study of other poets.
He was not classic: he was romantic&mdash;a poet who surrendered
himself to the music within him and did not care. "To me,"
he declared in his defense of poesy, "the savage of the plains
or the negro of the South is a truer poet than the scholar of
Oxford. They may have been alike born with a love of the
beautiful, but the scholar, shut up within the gloomy walls,
with his eyes to a dusty book, has forgotten the face of Nature
and learned only the art of <span class="locked">utterance."<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></span> This is one of the
keys to the new era that opened in the seventies. It explains
the new laughter of the West, it explains the Pike balladry,
it explains the new burst of democratic fiction, the studies of
lowly life in obscure environments. "To these poets," he continues;
"these lovers of the beautiful; these silent thinkers; these
mighty mountaineers, far away from the rush and roar of commerce;
these men who have room and strength and the divine
audacity to think and act for themselves&mdash;to these men who dare
to have heart and enthusiasm, who love the beautiful world that
the Creator made for them, I look for the leaven of our loaf."</p>

<p>Miller comes nearer to Mark Twain than to any other writer,
unless it be John Muir. True, he is wholly without humor, true
he had never been a boy, and in his mother's words had "never
played, never had playthings, never wanted them"; yet notwithstanding
this the two men are to be classed together. Both are
the recorders of a vanished era of which they were a part; both
emerged from the material which they used; both wrote notable
prose&mdash;Miller's <i>Life Among the Modocs</i> and his other autobiographic
picturings rank with <i>Life on the Mississippi</i>; both
worked with certainty in one of the great romantic areas of
human history. There is in the poems of Miller, despite all their
crudity, a sense of adventure, of glorious richness, of activity in
the open air, that is all his own. His Byronism and his Swinburneism
were but externals, details of manner: the song and
the atmosphere about it were his own, spun out of his own observation
and colored by his own unique personality.</p>

<p>His own definition of poetry determines his place among the
poets and explains his message: "To me a poem must be a picture,"
and it must, he further declared, be drawn always from
Nature by one who has seen and who knows. "The art of poetry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
is found in books; the inspiration of poetry is found only in
Nature. This book, the book of Nature, I studied in the wilderness
like a monk for many years." The test of poetry, he maintained,
is the persistence with which it clings in the memory,
not the words but the picture. Judged by this standard, <i>Songs
of the Sierras</i>, which is a succession of gorgeous pictures that
cling in the imagination, must rank high.</p>

<p>It was his ideal to draw his generation away from their pursuit
of gold and their slavery in the artificial round of the cities, their
worship of European culture, European architecture, European
books, and show them the beauties of their own land, the glories
of the life out of doors, the heroism and sacrifice of the pioneers
who made possible the later period.</p>

<p>"Grateful that I was born in an age of active and mighty
enterprise, and exulting, even as a lad, in the primitive glory
of nature, wild woods, wild birds, wild beasts, I began, as my
parents pushed west through the wilderness, to make beauty
and grandeur the god of my idolatry, even before I yet knew the
use of words. To give expression to this love and adoration, to
lead others to see grandeur, good, glory in all things animate or
inanimate, rational or irrational, was my early and has ever been
my one aspiration."</p>

<p>He would be the prophet of a new era. To the bards who
are to come he flings out the challenge: "The Old World has
been written, written fully and bravely and well.... Go forth
in the sun, away into the wilds, or contentedly lay aside your
aspirations of song. Now, mark you distinctly, I am not writing
for nor of the poets of the Old World or the Atlantic seaboard.
They have their work and their way of work. My notes are for
the songless Alaskas, Canadas, Californias, the Aztec lands and
the Argentines that patiently await their coming <span class="locked">prophets."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></span></p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The treatment of Miller by his own countrymen has never
been so laudatory as that accorded him by other lands, notably
England, but his complaint that his own people neglected him
is groundless. All the leading magazines&mdash;the <i>Atlantic</i>, <i>Scribner's</i>,
the <i>Independent</i>, and the rest&mdash;opened their columns to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
him freely. That reviews of his work and critical estimates of
him generally were more caustic on this side the Atlantic came
undoubtedly from the fact that the critic who was to review him
approached his book always in a spirit of irritation at the British
insistence that an American book to be worth the reading must
be redolent of the wild and the uncouth, must deal with Indians,
and buffaloes, and the various extremes of democracy. Miller has
been the chief victim of this controversy&mdash;a controversy, indeed,
which was waged through the whole period. The eccentricities of
the man and his ignorance and his picturesque crudeness, set over
against the extravagant claims of British writers, aroused prejudices
that blinded the American critic to the poet's real worth.</p>

<p>On the whole the English have been right. Not that American
literature to be of value must be shaggy and ignorant, a thing
only of Pikes and slang and dialect. It means rather that the
new period which opened in the seventies demanded genuineness,
reality, things as they are, studies from life rather than
studies from books; that it demanded not the reëchoing of outworn
ideals and measures from other lands, but the spirit of
America, of the new Western world, of the new soul of the new
republic. And what poet has caught more of this fresh new
America than the singer of the Sierras, the singer of the great
American deserts, and the northern Yukon?</p>

<span class="subhead">THE TRANSITION POETS</span></h2>

<p>The second generation of poets in America, those later singers
born during the vital thirties in which had appeared the earliest
books of the older school, began its work during the decade before
the Civil War. It was not a group that had been launched,
as were the earlier poets of the century, by a spiritual and moral
cataclysm, or by a new strong tide in the national life. It was
a school of deliberate art, the inevitable classical school which
follows ever upon the heels of the creative epoch.</p>

<p>It came as a natural product of mid-century conditions.
America, hungry for culture, had fed upon the romantic pabulum
furnished so abundantly in the thirties and the forties. It looked
away from the garish daylight of the new land of its birth into
the delicious twilight of the lands across the sea, with their ruins
and their legends and their old romance.</p>

<p>We have seen how it was an age of sugared epithet, of adolescent
sadness and longing, of sentiment even to sentimentality.
Its dreams were centered in the East, in that old world over
which there hung the glamour of romance. "I hungrily read,"
writes Bayard Taylor of this epoch in his life, "all European
books of travel, and my imagination clothed foreign countries
with a splendid atmosphere of poetry and art.... Italy! and
Greece! the wild enthusiasm with which I should tread those
lands, and view the shrines 'where young Romance and Love
like sister pilgrims turn'; the glorious emotions of my soul, and
the inspiration I should draw from them, which I now partly feel.
How my heart leaps at the sound of:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Woods that wave on Delphi's steep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Isles that gem the Ægean deep.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">The isles of Greece! hallowed by Homer and Milton and Byron!
My words are cold and tame compared with my burning
<span class="locked">thoughts."<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
The increasing tide of translations that marked the thirties
and the forties, the new editions of English and continental
poets&mdash;Shelley, Keats, Heine; the early books of the Victorians&mdash;Elizabeth
Barrett Browning, the young Tennyson&mdash;came across
the sea to these sensitive souls like visitants from another planet.
"I had the misfortune," Taylor writes in 1848, "to be intoxicated
yesterday&mdash;with Tennyson's new poem, 'The Princess.'...
For the future, for a long time at least, I dare not read Tennyson.
His poetry would be the death of mine. His intense perception
of beauty haunts me for days, and I cannot drive it
from <span class="locked">me."<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Poetry was a thing to be spoken of with awed lips like love
or the deeper longings of the soul. It was an ethereal thing
apart from the prose of life; it was beauty, melody, divinest art&mdash;a
thing broken into harshly by the daily round, a thing to be
stolen away to in golden hours, as Stoddard and Taylor stole
away on Saturday nights to read their poets and their own
poems, and to lose themselves in a more glorious world. "My
favorite poet was Keats, and his was Shelley, and we pretended
to believe that the souls of these poets had returned to earth in
our bodies. My worship of my master was restricted to a silent
imitation of his diction; my comrade's worship of his master
took the form of an ode to Shelley.... It is followed in the
volume before me by an airy lyric on 'Sicilian Wine,' which was
written out of his head, as the children say, for he had no Sicilian
wine, nor, indeed, wine of any other <span class="locked">vintage."<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>It explains the weakness of the whole school. All too often
did these young poets of the second generation write from out
their heads rather than their hearts. They were practitioners of
the poetic art rather than eager workers in the stuff that is
human life. They were inspired not by their times and the actual
life that touched elbows with theirs in their toil from day
to day; they were inspired by other singers. Poetry they wove
from poetry; words from words. Song begotten from other song
perishes with its singer. To endure, poetry must come from
"that inexpressible aching feeling of the heart"&mdash;from the impact
of life upon life; it must thrill with the deepest emotions
of its creator's soul as he looks beyond his books and all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
printed words of others into the yearning, struggling world of
men.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>The members of this second generation of poets fall into two
distinct groups: first, those who caught not at all the new note
that came into American life and American literature after the
war, and so, like the survivors of the earlier school, went on to
the end only echoing and reëchoing the earlier music; and, secondly,
those transitional poets who yielded to the change of times
and retuned their instruments to the new key. Of the first
group four only may be mentioned: Thomas Buchanan Read
(1822&ndash;1872), George Henry Boker (1823&ndash;1890), Bayard Taylor
(1825&ndash;1878), and Richard Henry Stoddard (1825&ndash;1903). None
of these may be called a poet of the transition; none of these, not
even Taylor, caught the new spirit of recreated America; none
of them added to poetry any notes that have influenced the song
or the life or the spirit of later years. They were poets of
beauty without a message, and they caught no new vision of
beauty.</p>

<p>The work of the group began early, only a few years later than
that of the major singers. Taylor's <i>Ximena</i> appeared in 1844;
Boker's <i>Lesson of Life</i> and Read's <i>Poems</i> in 1847; and Stoddard's
<i>Footprints</i> in 1849. By 1870 they had settled into their
final manner. It was theirs to strike the last notes, ineffective
and all too often decadent, of that mid-century music that had
begun with Bryant and Poe, with Emerson and Whittier, with
Willis and Longfellow.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>We may pause a moment with Taylor. His personality in the
early seventies undoubtedly was more potent in America than
that of any other poet. His was the leading poetic voice of the
Centennial of 1876, that great national gathering that marks in
a way the birth of the new American spirit.</p>

<p>But Taylor was not at all an original force. His power lay
in his picturesque personality. His Macaulay-like memory
charged with enormous store of literature from all lands and at
instant command; his bluff and hearty manner; and the atmosphere
of romance which surrounded him, made him a marked man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
wherever he went. He appealed to the imagination of adolescent
America. Like Byron, he had traveled far in the mysterious
East; there was the sensuousness and dreaminess of the Orient
about him; he had "ripened," as he expressed it, "in the suns
of many lands."</p>

<p>The weakness of Taylor was the weakness of Stoddard, of
Aldrich, of the early Stedman, of all the poets of beauty. They
had drunk like the young Tennyson of the fatal draft of Keats.
To them beauty concerned itself with the mere externals of sense.
Keats is the poet of rich interiors, of costly hangings, and embroidered
garments. To read him is to come into the presence
of rare wines, of opiates that lap one in long forgetfulness, of
softly whispering flutes and viols, of rare tables heaped with
luscious dainties brought from far, of all the golden East can
bring of luxury of furnishings and beauty of form and color.
"A thing of beauty," he sings, "is a joy forever," but beauty to
Keats is only that which brings delight to the senses. Of beauty
of the soul he knows nothing. His women are Greek goddesses:
nothing more. In Keats, and later in his disciples, Taylor and
Stoddard and Aldrich, we never come face to face with souls in
conflict for eternal principles. Shelley looked at life about him
and reacted upon it. He showed us Prometheus bound to the
rock for refusal to yield to tyrannic law, and then liberated by
the new soul of human love. He believed that he had a vision
of a new heaven and earth with Reason as its god and Love its
supreme soul, and he beat out his life in eagerness to bring men
into this new heaven in the clouds. Keats reacted upon nothing
save the material which he found in books: translations from the
Greek, Spenser, Shakespeare, that earlier adolescent dreamer
Marlowe, Milton, Coleridge. With the exception of hints from
"Christabel" which we find worked into "The Eve of St. Agnes"
and "Lamia," Keats never got nearer his own century than
Milton's day. He turned in disgust from the England about
him&mdash;that England with its Benthamite individualism, inheritance
from the French Revolution, which even then was culminating
in all the misery and riot and civil strife that later we find
pictured in the novels of Dickens and Kingsley&mdash;he turned from
it to the world of merely sensuous delight, where selfishly he might
swoon away in a dream of beauty.</p>

<p>Taylor and Stoddard and the early Aldrich reacted not at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
on the America that so sadly needed them. They added sentiment
to the music of Keats and dreamed of the Orient with its
life of sensuous surfeit:</p>

<p>"Taylor, Boker, Stoddard, Read, Story, and their allies," confessed
Stedman in his later years, "wrote poetry for the sheer
love of it. They did much beautiful work, with a cosmopolitan
and artistic bent, making it a part of the varied industry of men
of letters; in fact, they were creating a civic Arcadia of their
<span class="locked">own."<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>But in making this civic Arcadia of their own they deliberately
neglected the opportunity of reacting upon the actual civic life
of their own land in their own and later times. They lived in
one of the great germinal periods in the history of the race and
they deliberately chose to create a little Arcadia of their own.</p>

<p>No man of the century, save Lowell, was given the opportunity
to react upon the new world of America at a critical moment
such as was given to Taylor at the Centennial in 1876. Subject
and occasion there were worthy of a Milton. A new America had
arisen from the ashes of the war, eager and impetuous. A new
era had begun whose glories we of a later century are just beginning
to realize. Who was to voice that era? The land needed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
a poet, a seer, a prophet, and in Taylor it had only a dreamer of
beauty, gorgeous of epithet, musical, sensuous. "The National
Ode," when we think of what the occasion demanded, must be
classed as one of the greatest failures in the history of American
literature. Freneau's "The Rising Glory of America," written
in 1772, is an incomparably better ode. There are no lines in
Taylor's poem to grip the heart and send the blood into quicker
beat; there are no magnificent climaxes as in Lowell's odes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Virginia gave us this imperial man.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Mother of States and undiminished men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou gavest us a country giving him.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">New birth of our new soil, the first American.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>There is excessive tinkling of rimes; there is forcing of measures
that could have come only of haste; there is lack of incisiveness
and of distinctive poetic phrases that cling in the memory
and become current coin; there is lack of vision and of message.
The poet of beauty was unequal to his task. There was needed
a prophet and a creative soul, and the lack of such a leader at
the critical moment accounts in part perhaps for the poetic leanness
of the period that was to come.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>The poets of the second group, the transition poets, for the most
part were born during the thirties. Like Taylor and Stoddard,
they were poets of beauty who read other poets with eagerness
and wrote with deliberation. Their early volumes are full of exquisitely
finished work modeled upon Theocritus and Heine, upon
Keats and Shelley. They reacted but little upon the life about
them; they railed upon America as crude and raw, a land without
adequate art, and were content to fly away into the world of
beauty and forget.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the war crashed in their ears. For the first
time they caught a vision of life, of their country, of themselves,
and for the first time they burst into real song. "For eight
years," wrote the young Stedman in 1861, "I have cared <i>nothing</i>
for politics&mdash;have been disgusted with American life and doings.
Now for the first time I am proud of my country and my grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
heroic brethren. The greatness of the crisis, the Homeric
grandeur of the contest, surrounds and elevates us all....
Henceforth the sentimental and poetic will fuse with the intellectual
to dignify and elevate the <span class="locked">race."<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Edmund Clarence Stedman was of old New England stock.
He had inherited with his blood what Howells termed, in words
that might have emanated from Dr. Holmes himself, "the quality
of Boston, the honor and passion of literature." He was born in
Hartford, Connecticut, October 8, 1833. Bereft of his father
when he was but two years of age, and later, when he was a mere
child, forced to leave his mother and live with an uncle who could
little supply the place that only father and mother can fill in a
boy's life, he grew into a headstrong, moody youth who resented
control. He was a mere lad of fifteen when he entered Yale, the
youngest member indeed of his class, and his rustication two years
later was only a natural result. Boyishness and high spirits and
impetuous independence of soul are not crimes, however, and the
college in later years was glad to confer upon him his degree.</p>

<p>Returning to Norwich, the home of his uncle, he pursued for
a time the study of law. Later he connected himself with the
local newspaper, and in 1853, at the age of twenty, he was married.
Two years later, he left newspaper work to become the
New York representative of a firm which was to engage in the
manufacture and sale of clocks. Accordingly in the summer of
1855 he took up for the first time his residence in the city that was
to be so closely connected with the rest of his life.</p>

<p>The clock factory made haste to burn and Stedman again was
out of employment, this time in the great wilderness of New York.
For a time he was a real estate and commission broker, later he
was a clerk in a railroad office. Still later he attracted wide
attention with his ephemeral poem "The Diamond Wedding,"
and on the strength of this work became a correspondent of the
<i>Tribune</i>. In 1861 he went to the front as war correspondent of
the Washington <i>World</i>, and his letters during the early years of
the struggle were surpassed by those of no other correspondent.
In 1862 he was given a position in the office of the Attorney-General
and a year later he began his career as a broker in Wall
Street, a career that was to hold him in its grip for the rest of
his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
Pan and Wall Street are far from synonymous. There was
poetry in Stedman's soul; there were within him creative powers
that he felt were able to place him among the masters if he could
but command time to study his art. He worshiped beauty and
he was compelled to keep his eye upon the stock-ticker. He read
Keats and Tennyson, Moschus and Theocritus, but it was always
after the freshness of his day had been given to the excitement
of the market place. Time and again he sought to escape, but
the pressure of city life was upon him. He had a growing family
now and there were no resources save those that came from his
office. It was a precarious business in which he engaged; it was
founded upon uncertainty; failure might come at any moment
through no fault of his own. Several times during his life he
was on the brink of ruin. Time and again his health failed him,
but he still struggled on. The financial chapter of his biography
is one of the most pathetic in literary annals. But through toil
and discouragement, amid surroundings fatal to poetic vision, he
still kept true to his early literary ideals, and his output when
measured either in volumes or in literary merit is remarkable.</p>

<p>The first period of Stedman's poetic life produced little save
colorless, passionless lyrics, the echoes of a wide reading in other
poets. He went, like all of his clan, to books rather than life. He
was early enamoured of the Sicilian idylists. It was a dream that
never quite deserted him, to make "a complete, metrical, English
version of the idyls of Theocritus, Moschus, and Bion"&mdash;an idle
dream indeed for a vigorous young poet in a land that needed
the breath of a new life. Why dawdle over Theocritus when
fields are newly green and youth is calling? Stedman himself
seems to have misgivings. "When the job [the collecting of the
various texts] was nearly ended, I reflected that one's freshest
years should be given to original work, and such excursions might
well be deferred to the pleasures of old age. My time seemed to
have been <span class="locked">wasted."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>During this earlier period poetry was to him an artistic thing
to be judged coldly from the standpoint of art and beauty. He
worked with extreme care upon his lines. For a time he considered
that he had reached his highest level in "Alcetryon," and
he waited eagerly for the world to discover it. William Winter,
his fellow poet of beauty, hailed it as "not unworthy of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
greatest living poet, Tennyson"; Professor Hadley of Yale pronounced
it "one of the most successful modern-antiques that I
have ever seen." Then Lowell, with one of his flashes of insight,
told the whole truth: "I don't believe in these modern antiques&mdash;no,
not in Landor, not in Swinburne, not in any of 'em. They
are all wrong. It is like writing Latin verses&mdash;the material you
work in is dead." It was the voice of an oracle to the young
poet. Twenty-three years later he wrote of his chagrin when
Lowell had praised his volume in the <i>North American Review</i> and
had said nothing of his <i>pièce de résistance</i> "Alectryon."
"Finally I hinted as much to him. He at once said that it was
my 'best piece of work,' but no 'addition to poetic literature,'
since we already have enough masterpieces of that kind&mdash;from
Landor's <i>Hamadryad</i> and Tennyson's <i>&OElig;none</i> down to the latest
effort by Swinburne or Mr. Fields.... Upon reflection, I
thought Lowell right. A new land calls for new <span class="locked">song."<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>The episode is a most significant one. It marks the passing of
a whole poetic school.</p>

<p>To the war period that followed this era in the poet's life belong
the deepest notes of Stedman's song. In his <i>Alice of Monmouth</i>,
he is no longer the mere poet of beauty, he is the interpreter
of the thrill, the sacrifice, the soul of the great war. The
poem has the bite of life in it. "The Cavalry Song" thrills with
the very soul of battle:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dash on beneath the smoking dome,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through level lightnings gallop nearer!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One look to Heaven! no thoughts of home:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The guidons that we bear are dearer.<br /></span>
<span class="i10"><span class="smcap">Charg-e!</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Cling! Clang! forward all!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Heaven help those whose horses fall!<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Cut left and right!<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>The poem "Wanted&mdash;a Man" written in the despondent autumn
of 1862, came not from books, but hot from a man's heart:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span></p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">Give us the man of thousands ten,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O, we will follow him to the death,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where the foeman's fiercest columns are!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, we will use our latest breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Cheering for every sacred star!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Abraham Lincoln, give us a <span class="smcap">Man</span>!<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>Poems like this will not die. They are a part of the deeper
history of America. They are worth more than ships or guns or
battlements. Only a few notes like this did Stedman strike.
Once again its deep note rang in "The Hand of Lincoln":</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lo, as I gaze, that statured man,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Built up from yon large hand, appears:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A type that Nature wills to plan<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But once in all a people's years.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What better than this voiceless cast<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To tell of such a one as he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since through its living semblance passed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The thought that bade a race be free!<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>Another deep note he struck in that war period that so shook
him, a note called forth by personal bereavement and put into
immortal form in "The Undiscovered Country," a song that was
to be sung at the funerals of his wife and his sons, and later at
his own:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Could we but know<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The land that ends our dark, uncertain travel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where lie those happier hills and meadows low&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ah, if beyond the spirit's inmost cavil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aught of that Country could we surely know,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Who would not go?<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>Aside from a handful of spontaneous love songs&mdash;"At Twilight,"
"Autumn Song," "Stanzas for Music," "Song from a
Drama," "Creole Love Song"&mdash;nothing else of Stedman's poetic
work greatly matters. He is a lyrist who struck a few true notes,
a half dozen perhaps&mdash;thin indeed in volume, but those few immortal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
As the new period progressed, the period in America that had
awakened to the full realization that "a new land needs new
song," he became gradually silent as a singer and gave himself
more and more to prose criticism, a work for which nature had
peculiarly endowed him.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>In this transition group, poets of external beauty, <i>Spätromantiker</i>
yet classicists in their reverence for rule and tradition and
in their struggle for perfection, the typical figure is Thomas
Bailey Aldrich (1836&ndash;1907). By birth he was a New Englander,
a native of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where he spent that
boyhood which he made classic in the <i>Story of a Bad Boy</i>. Three
years in New Orleans whither his father had moved for business
reasons, years that seem to have made slight impression upon him,
and then, his father dying and a college course becoming out of
the question, he went with his mother to New York, where he
resided for fourteen years, or between 1852 and 1866. It was a
period of activity and of contact with many things that were to
influence his later life. He held successively the positions of
counting-room clerk, junior literary critic on the <i>Evening
Mirror</i>, sub-editor of the <i>Home Journal</i>, literary adviser to Derby
and Jackson, and managing editor of the <i>Illustrated News</i>. He
formed a close friendship with Taylor and Stoddard and Stedman,
and he saw something of the Bohemian group that during
the late fifties and early sixties made headquarters at Pfaff's celebrated
resort, 647 Broadway. Then came his call to Boston as
editor of <i>Every Saturday</i>, his adoption as a Brahmin, his residence
on Beacon Street, and his admission to the inner circle of
the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>.</p>

<p>Aldrich's literary life was from first to last a struggle between
his Bohemian New York education and his later Brahmin classicism.
His first approach to poetry had been through G.&nbsp;P.
Morris and Willis on the <i>Mirror</i> and the <i>Journal</i>. From them it
was that he learned the strain of sentimentalism which was to
produce such poems as "Mabel, Little Mabel," "Marian, May,
and Maud," and "Babie Bell." Then swiftly he had come under
the spell of Longfellow's German romance, with its Emma of
Ilmenau maidens, its delicious sadness and longing, and its worship
of the night&mdash;that dreamy old-world atmosphere which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
so influenced the mid century. It possessed the young poet completely,
so completely that he never freed himself entirely from
its spell. Longfellow was his poet master:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O Poet-soul! O gentle one!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy thought has made my darkness light;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The solemn voices of the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have filled me with an inner tone.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I'll drink thy praise in olden wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And in the cloak of fine conceite<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I'll tell thee how my pulses beat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How half my being runs to thine.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">Then had come the acquaintance with Taylor and Stoddard, and
through them the powerful influence of Keats and Tennyson.</p>

<p>To study the evolution of Aldrich as a poet, one need not linger
long over <i>The Bells</i> (1855), that earliest collection of echoes and
immaturities; one will do better to begin with his prose work,
<i>Daisy's Necklace</i>, published two years later, a book that has a
significance out of all proportion to its value. As we read it we
are aware for the first time of the fact which was to become more
and more evident with every year, that there were two Aldriches:
the New York romanticist dreaming over his <i>Hyperion</i>, his Keats,
his Tennyson, and the Boston classicist, severe with all exuberance,
correct, and brilliant. The book is crude, a mere <i>mélange</i>
of quotations and echoes, fantastic often and sentimental, yet one
cannot read a chapter of it without feeling that it was written
with all seriousness. When, for example, the young poet speaks
of "The Eve of St. Agnes," we know that he speaks from his
heart: "I sometimes think that this poem is the most exquisite
definition of one phase of poetry in our language. Musical
rhythm, imperial words, gorgeous color and luxurious conceit
seemed to have culminated in it." But in the Prologue and the
Epilogue of the book there is the later Aldrich, the classicist and
critic, who warns us that the work is not to be taken seriously:
that it is a mere burlesque, an extravaganza.</p>

<p>In his earlier work he is a true member of the New York
school. He looks at life and poetry from the same standpoint
that Taylor and Stoddard had viewed them in their attic room on
those ambrosial nights when they had really lived. Taylor's
<i>Poems of the Orient</i>, inspired by Shelley's "Lines to an Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
Air" and by Tennyson's "Recollections of the Arabian Nights,"
made a profound impression upon him. Stoddard, who soon was
to issue his <i>Book of the East</i>, was also to the young poet like one
from a rarer world. When in 1858 Aldrich in his twenty-second
year issued his gorgeous oriental poem, <i>The Course of True Love
Never Did Run Smooth</i>, he dedicated it to Stoddard, "under
whose fingers this story would have blossomed into true Arabian
roses." To his next volume he was to add <i>Cloth of Gold</i>, a
grouping of sensuous lyrics breathing the soul of "The Eve of
St. Agnes": "Tiger Lilies," "The Sultana," "Latakia,"
"When the Sultan Goes to Ispahan," and others. Even as Taylor
and Stoddard, he dreamed that his soul was native in the
East:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">I must have known<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life otherwhere in epochs long since fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in my veins some Orient blood is red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through my thoughts are lotus blossoms blown.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">Everywhere in this earlier work sensuous beauty, soft music
faintly heard in an atmosphere breathing sandal-wood, and
oriental perfume:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lavender and spikenard sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And attars, nedd, and richest musk.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">Everywhere rich interiors, banquets fit for Porphyro to spread
for Madeline, and, dimly seen in the spice-breathing twilight, the
maiden of his dreams:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The music sang itself to death,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The lamps died out in their perfume:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abbassa, on a silk divan,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sate in the moonlight of her room.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her handmaid loosed her scented hair<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With lily fingers; from her brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Released the diamond, and unlaced<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The robe that held her bosom's snow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Removed the slippers from her feet<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And led her to an ivory bed.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>Had Aldrich persisted in such work, he would have become
simply another Stoddard, an echoer of soft sweetness, out of
print in the generation following his death. But for Aldrich
there was a restraining force. The classicist, the Brahmin, within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
the sentimental young poet was to be awakened by the greatest
of the classicists and the Brahmins, Dr. Holmes, himself. "You
must not feed too much on 'apricots and dewberries,'" he wrote
in 1863. "There is an exquisite sensuousness that shows through
your words and rounds them into voluptuous swells of rhythm as
'invisible fingers of air' lift the diaphanous gauzes. Do not let
it run away with you. You love the fragrance of certain words
so well that you are in danger of making nosegays when you
should write poems.... Your tendency to vanilla-flavored adjectives
and patchouli-scented participles stifles your strength in
cloying <span class="locked">euphemisms."<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Wise criticism, but the critic said nothing of a deeper and more
insidious fault. There was no originality in Aldrich's earlier
work. Everywhere it echoed other poetry. Like Taylor and
Stoddard, the poet had so saturated himself with the writings
of others that unconsciously he imitated. One can illustrate this
no better perhaps than by examining a passage which Boynton
in a review of the poet cites as beauty of the highest order. It
is from the poem "Judith":</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thy breath upon my cheek is as the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blown from a far-off grove of cynnamon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fairer art thou than is the night's one star;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou makest me a poet with thine eyes.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">Beautiful indeed it is, but one cannot help thinking of Keats'
"Eve's one star" and Marlowe's:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, thou art fairer than the evening air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clad in the beauty of a thousand stars;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brighter art thou than flaming Jupiter.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">One has, too, an uneasy feeling that the whole poem would never
have been written but for Arnold's "Sohrab and Rustum" and
Tennyson's narratives.</p>

<p>Aldrich's later life was a prolonged struggle against the poetic
habits of this New York period of his training. The second side
of his personality, however, that severe classical spirit which made
war with his romantic excesses, more and more possessed him. "I
have a way," he wrote in 1900, "of looking at my own verse as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
if it were written by some man I didn't like very well, and thus
I am able to look at it rather impersonally, and to discover when
I have fallen into mere 'fine writing,' a fault I am inclined to,
while I detest <span class="locked">it."<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Imitation was his besetting sin. It was his realization of this
fact more than anything else that caused him to omit from later
editions such wide areas of his earlier work. Of the forty-eight
poems in <i>The Bells</i> he suffered not one to be reprinted; of his
second volume he reprinted only two fragments: "Dressing the
Bride" and "Songs from the Persian"; of the forty-seven lyrics
in his third volume he admitted only seven into his definitive
edition, and of the twenty in his fourth volume he spared but five.
Of the vast number of lyrics that he had produced before the edition
of 1882 only thirty-three were deemed of enough value to be
admitted into his final canon.</p>

<p>It was not alone on account of its lack of finish that this enormous
mass of poetical material was condemned. The poet had
been born with nothing in particular to say. Nothing had compelled
him to write save a dilettante desire to work with beautiful
things. His life had known no period of storm and stress from
which were to radiate new forces. His poems had been therefore
not creations, but exercises to be thrown aside when the mood had
passed. Exquisite work it often was, but there was no experience
in it, no depth of life, no color of any soil save that of the dream-world
of other poets.</p>

<p>The Aldrich of the later years became more and more an artist,
a seeker for the perfect, a classicist. "The things that have come
down to us," he wrote once to Stedman, "the things that have
<i>lasted</i>, are perfect in form. I believe many a fine thought has
perished being inadequately expressed, and I know that many a
light fancy is immortal because of its perfect <span class="locked">wording."<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></span> He
defended himself again and again from the charge that he was a
mere carver of cherry stones, a maker of exquisite trifles.
"Jones's or Smith's lines," he wrote in 1897, "'to my lady's eyebrow'&mdash;which
is lovely in every age&mdash;will outlast nine-tenths of
the noisy verse of our stress and storm period. Smith or Jones
who never dreamed of having a Mission, will placidly sweep down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
to posterity over the fall of a girl's eyelash, leaving our shrill
didactic singers high and dry on the sands of <span class="locked">time."<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>He has summed it up in his "Funeral of a Minor Poet":</p>

<p class="in0">And again in his poem "Art":</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Let art be all in all," one time I said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And straightway stirred the hypercritic gall:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I said not, "Let technique be all in all,"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But art&mdash;a wider meaning.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>His essay on Herrick was in reality an apology for himself:
"It sometimes happens that the light love song, reaching few or
no ears at its first singing, outlasts the seemingly more prosperous
ode which, dealing with some passing phase of thought, social or
political, gains the instant applause of the multitude.... His
workmanship places him among the masters.... Of passion, in
the deeper sense, Herrick has little or none. Here are no 'tears
from the depth of some divine despair,' no probing into the tragic
heart of man, no insight that goes much further than the pathos
of a cowslip on a maiden's grave."</p>

<p>All this is true so far as it goes, but it must never be forgotten
that beauty is a thing that concerns itself with far more than the
externals of sense. To be of positive value it must deal with the
soul of man and the deeps of human life. A poet now and then
may live because of his lyric to a girl's eyelash, but it is certain
that the greater poets of the race have looked vastly deeper than
this or they never would have survived the years. Unless the
poet sees beyond the eyelash into the soul and the deeps of life,
he will survive his generation only by accident or by circumstance,
a fact that Aldrich himself tacitly admitted in later years by
dropping from the final edition of his poems all lyrics that had
as their theme the merely trivial.</p>

<p>To the early Aldrich, life had been too kind. He had known
nothing of the bitterness of defeat, the losing battle with fate, the
inexorableness of bereavement. He had little sympathy with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
his times and their problems, and with his countrymen. Like
Longfellow, he lived in his study and his study had only eastern
windows. Herrick, whom he defended as a poet immortal because
of trifles made perfect, can never be charged with this. No singer
ever held more to his own soil and the spirit of his own times.
His poems everywhere are redolent of England, of English
meadows and streams, of English flowers. He is an English poet
and only an English poet. But so far as one may learn from his
earlier work, Aldrich might have lived in England or indeed in
France. From such lyrics as "The Winter Robin" one would
guess that he was English. Surely when he longs for the spring
and the return of the jay we may conclude with certainty that
he was not a New Englander.</p>

<p>During his earlier life he was in America but not of it. Even
the war had little effect upon him. He was inclined to look at
life from the standpoint of the aristocrat. He held himself aloof
from his generation with little of sympathy for the struggling
masses. He was suspicious of democracy: "We shall have
bloody work in this country some of these days," he wrote to
Woodberry in 1894, "when the lazy <i>canaille</i> get organized. They
are the spawn of Santerre and Fouquier-Tinville."<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> And again,
"Emerson's mind would have been enriched if he could have had
more terrapin and less fish-ball."</p>

<p>The mighty westward movement in America after the war concerned
him not at all. Much in the new literary movement repelled
him. He denounced Kipling and declared that he would
have rejected the "Recessional" had it been offered to the
<i>Atlantic</i>. Realism he despised:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The mighty Zolaistic Movement now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Engrosses us&mdash;a miasmatic breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blown from the slums. We paint life as it is,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hideous side of it, with careful pains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making a god of the dull Commonplace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For have we not the old gods overthrown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And set up strangest idols?<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">A poet should be a leader of his generation. He should be in
sympathy with it; he should interpret the nation to itself; he
should have vision and he should be a compeller of visions. It
is not his mission weakly to complain that the old is passing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
that the new is strange and worthless. The America of the seventies
and the eighties was tremendously alive. It was breaking
new areas and organizing a new empire in the West; it was lifting
up a splendid new hope for all mankind. It needed a poet, and
its poets were looking eastward and singing of the fall of my
lady's eyelash.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>The best refutation of Aldrich is furnished by Aldrich himself.
The years between 1881 and 1890, the period of his editorship of
the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, were a time of small production, of pause
and calm, of ripening, of final adjustment. Following his resignation
of the editorship, he began again actively to produce poetry
and now for ten or twelve years he worked in contemporary life&mdash;in
occasional and commemorative odes, monodies and elegies; in
studies of the deeper meanings of life; in problems of death and
of destiny. The volumes of 1891, 1895, and 1896 contain the
soul of all his poetry. From them he omitted practically nothing
when at last he made up the definitive edition of his work. The
Aldrich of the sixties and the seventies had been trivial, artificial,
sentimental; the Aldrich who wrote in the nineties had a purpose:
he worked now in the deeps of life; he was in earnest; he had a
message. It is significant in view of his oft expressed theories of
poetry that when in 1897 Stedman asked him to indicate his best
lyrics for publication in the <i>American Anthology</i>, he chose these:
"Shaw Memorial Ode," "Outward Bound," "Andromeda,"
"Reminiscence," "The Last Cæsar," "Alice Yeaton's Son,"
"Unguarded Gates," "A Shadow of the Night," "Monody
on Wendell Phillips," "To Hafiz," "Prescience," "Santo
Domingo," "Tennyson," "Memory," "Twilight," "Quits"&mdash;all
but one of them, "Prescience," first published after
1891. There are no "apricots and dewberries" about these
masterly lyrics; they deal with no such trivialities as the
fall of an eyelash. They thrill with the problems of life
and with experience. It was not until this later period that
the poet could say to a bereaved friend: "You will recall
a poem of mine entitled 'A Shadow of the Night.' There is
a passage here and there that might possibly appeal to you"&mdash;a
severe test, but one that reveals the true poet. What has he for
his generation? What has he for the crises of life, inevitably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
must be asked at last of every poet. His change of ideals he
voiced in "Andromeda":</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The smooth-worn coin and threadbare classic phrase<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Grecian myths that did beguile my youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beguile me not as in the olden days:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think more grace and beauty dwell with truth.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>Now in the rich afternoon of his art the poet is no longer content
to echo the music of masters. He has awakened to the deeper
meanings of life; he is himself a master; he now has something to
say, and the years of his apprenticeship have given him a flawless
style in which to say it. No other American poet has approached
the perfect art of these later lyrics. Who else on this side of the
water could have written "The Sisters' Tragedy," with its melody,
its finish, its distinction of phrase?</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Both still were young, in life's rich summer yet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one was dark, with tints of violet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In hair and eye, and one was blonde as she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who rose&mdash;a second daybreak&mdash;from the sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gold tressed and azure-eyed.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>And, moreover, in addition to all this it is a quivering section
of human life. One reads on and on and then&mdash;sharply draws his
breath at the rapier thrust of the closing lines.</p>

<p>What a world of distance between the early sensuous poet of
the New York school and the seer of the later period who could
pen a lyric beginning,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O short-breathed music, dying on the tongue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere half the mystic canticle be sung!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O harp of life so speedily unstrung!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, if 't were his to choose, would know again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bitter sweetness of the last refrain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its rapture and its pain?<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">Or this in its flawless perfectness:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At noon of night, and at the night's pale end,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Such things have chanced to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one, by day, would scarcely tell a friend<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For fear of mockery.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Shadows, you say, mirages of the brain!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I know not, faith, not I.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it more strange the dead should walk again<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Than that the quick should die?<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>A few of his later sonnets, "Outward Bound," redolent of his
early love of the sea, "When to Soft Sleep We Give Ourselves
Away," "The Undiscovered Country," "Enamored Architect of
Airy Rhyme," and "I Vex Me Not with Brooding on the Years,"
have hardly been surpassed in American literature.</p>

<p>It was from this later period that Aldrich chose almost all of
his poems in that compressed volume which was to be his lasting
contribution to poetry, <i>A Book of Songs and Sonnets</i>. It is but
a fraction of his work, but it is all that will survive the years.
He will go down as the most finished poet that America has yet
produced; the later Landor, romantic yet severely classical; the
maker of trifles that were miracles of art; and finally as the belated
singer who awoke in his later years to message and vision
and produced with his mastered art a handful of perfect lyrics
that rank with the strongest that America has given to song.</p>

<span class="subhead">RISE OF THE NATURE WRITERS</span></h2>

<p>One phase of the new discovery of America following the Civil
War&mdash;return to reality, insistence upon things as they are&mdash;expressed
itself in nature study. While the new local color school
was ransacking the odd corners of the land for curious types of
humanity, these writers were calling attention to the hitherto unnoticed
phenomena of fields and meadows and woodlands. Handbooks
of birds and trees, nature guides and charts of all varieties
were multiplied. Nature study became an art, and it ranged all
the way from a fad for dilettantes to a solemn exercise in the
public school curriculum.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>The creator and inspirer and greatest figure of this school of
nature writers was Henry David Thoreau. In point of time he
was of the mid-century school that gathered about Emerson. He
was born in 1817, two years earlier than Lowell, and he died in
1862, the first to break the earlier group, yet in spirit and influence
and indeed in everything that makes for the final fixing of
an author's place in the literary history of his land, he belongs
to the period after 1870.</p>

<p>His own generation rejected Thoreau. They could see in him
only an imitator of Emerson and an exploiter of newnesses in an
age grown weary of newnesses. They did not condemn him: they
ignored him. Of his first book, <i>A Week on the Concord and
Merrimac Rivers</i>, 1849, printed at Thoreau's expense, only two
hundred and nineteen copies had been sold in 1853 when the
remainder of the edition was returned to the author. <i>Walden;
or, Life in the Woods</i> fared somewhat better because of the unique
social experiment which it recorded, but not enough better to encourage
its author ever to publish another book. After the death
of Thoreau, Emerson undertook to give him permanence by editing
four or five posthumous volumes made up of his scattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
magazine articles and papers, but even this powerful influence
could not arouse enthusiasm. The <i>North American Review</i>,
which in 1854 had devoted seven patronizing lines to <i>Walden</i>,
took no note of Emerson's editings until the <i>Letters to Various
Persons</i> appeared in 1865. Then it awoke in anger. To publish
the letters of an author is to proclaim that author's importance,
and what had Thoreau done save to live as a hermit for two years
in the woods? He was a mere eccentric, a "Diogenes in his
barrel, reducing his wants to a little sunlight"; one of "the
pistillate plants kindled to fruitage by the Emersonian pollen."
"It is something eminently fitting that his posthumous works
should be offered us by Emerson, for they are strawberries from
his own garden." He was an egotist, a poser for effect, a condemner
of what he could not himself attain to. "He condemns
a world, the hollowness of whose satisfactions he had never had
the means of testing." "He had no humor"; "he had little
active imagination"; "he was not by nature an observer." "He
turns commonplaces end for end, and fancies it makes something
new of them." His nature study was only "one more symptom
of the general liver complaint." "I look upon a great deal of
the modern sentimentalism about Nature as a mark of disease."</p>

<p>The review was from no less a pen than Lowell's and it carried
conviction. Its author spread it widely by republishing it in
<i>My Study Windows</i>, 1871, and including it in his collected works.
It was the voice of Thoreau's generation, and to England at least
it seems to have been the final word. Stevenson after reading the
essay was emboldened to sum up the man in one word, a
"skulker." The effect was almost equally strong in America.
During the period from 1868 to 1881, not one of the author's
volumes was republished in a new edition. When in 1870 Thomas
Wentworth Higginson, his foremost champion in the dark period,
had attempted to secure the manuscript journal for possible publication,
he was met by Judge Hoar, the latter-day guardian of
Concord, with the question: "Why should any one wish to have
Thoreau's journal printed?"</p>

<p>That was the attitude of the seventies. Then had come the
slow revival of the eighties. At the beginning of the decade
H.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;O. Blake, into whose hands Thoreau's papers had fallen,
began to publish extracts from the journals grouped according
to days and seasons: <i>Early Spring in Massachusetts</i>, 1881.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
<i>Summer</i>, 1884, and <i>Winter</i>, 1888. The break came in the nineties.
Between 1893 and 1906 were published, in addition to
many individual reprints of Thoreau's books, the Riverside edition
in ten volumes, the complete journal in fourteen volumes,
and the definitive Walden edition in twenty volumes. A Thoreau
cult had arisen that hailed him as leader and master. After all
the years he had arrived at his own. In the case of no other
American has there been so complete and overwhelming a reversal
of the verdict of an author's own generation.</p>

<p>Lowell devoted his whole essay to a criticism of Thoreau as a
Transcendental theorist and social reformer. To-day it is recognized
that fundamentally he was neither of these. His rehabilitation
has come solely because of that element condemned by
Lowell as a certain "modern sentimentalism about Nature." It
is not alone because he was a naturalist that he has lived, or
because he loved and lived with Nature: it was because he
brought to the study of Nature a new manner, because he created
a new nature sentiment, and so added a new field to literature.
Instead of having been an imitator of Emerson, he is now seen
to have been a positive original force, the most original, perhaps,
save Whitman, that has contributed to American literature.</p>

<p>The first fact of importance about Thoreau is the fact that he
wrote day after day, seldom a day omitted for years, the 6,811
closely printed pages of his journal, every part done with thoroughness
and finish, with no dream that it ever was to be published.
It is a fact enormously significant; it reveals to us the
naked man; it furnishes a basis for all constructive criticism.
"My journal," he wrote November 16, 1850, "should be the
record of my love. I would write in it only of the things I
love, my affection for an aspect of the world, what I love to think
of." And again, "Who keeps a journal is purveyor to the
gods." And still again, February 8, 1841, "My journal is that
of me which would else spill over and run to waste, gleanings
from the field which in action I reap. I must not live for it, but,
in it, for the gods. They are my correspondents, to whom daily
I send off this sheet, post-paid. I am clerk in their counting
house, and at evening transfer the account from day-book to
ledger." He was not a poser for effect, for it is impossible for one
to pose throughout 6,811 printed pages wrought for no eyes save
his own and the gods. His power came rather from the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
he did not pose; that he wrote spontaneously for the sheer love
of the writing. "I think," he declares in one place, "that the one
word that will explain the Shakespeare miracle is unconsciousness."
The word explains also Thoreau. Again he adds,
"There probably has been no more conscious age than the present."
The sentence is a key: in a conscious age, a classical age
building on books, watchful of conventions and precedents,
Thoreau stood true only to himself and Nature. Between him
and the school of Taylor and Stoddard there was the whole
diameter. He was affected only by the real, by experience, by
the testimony of his own soul. "The forcible writer," he wrote
February 3, 1852, "stands boldly behind his words with his experience.
He does not make books out of books, but he has been
<i>there</i> in person."</p>

<p>In his nature observations Thoreau was not a scientist. It
was not his object to collect endless data for the purpose of arriving
at laws and generalizations. He approached Nature
rather as a poet. There was in him an innate love for the wild
and elemental. He had, moreover, a passion for transcending,
or peering beyond, those bounds of ordinary experience and capturing
the half-divined secrets that Nature so jealously guards.
His attitude was one of perpetual wonder, that wonder of the
child which has produced the mythology of the race. Always
was he seeking to catch Nature for an instant off her guard. His
eyes were on the strain for the unseen, his ears for the unheard.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I was always conscious of sounds in Nature which my ears could
not hear, that I caught but a prelude to a strain. She always retreats
as I advance. Away behind and behind is she and her meaning. Will
not this faith and expectation make itself ears at length? I never saw
to the end, nor heard to the end, but the best part was unseen and unheard.&mdash;February
21, 1842.</p></blockquote>

<p>Nature so absorbed him that he lived constantly in an eager,
expectant atmosphere. "I am excited by this wonderful air,"
he writes, "and go, listening for the note of the bluebird or other
comer." It was not what he saw in Nature that was important;
it was what he felt. "A man has not seen a thing who has not
felt it." He took stock of his sensations like a miser. "As I
came home through the woods with my string of fish, trailing my
pole, it being now quite dark, I caught a glimpse of a woodchuck
stealing across my path, and felt a strange thrill of savage delight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
and was strongly tempted to seize and devour him raw;
not that I was hungry then, except for that wildness which he
represented." It was by this watchfulness for the elemental,
this constant scrutiny of instincts and savage outcroppings, that
he sought to master the secret that baffled him. He would keep
himself constantly in key, constantly sensitive to every fleeting
glimpse of harmony that Nature might vouchsafe him.</p>

<p>Nature stirred him always on the side of the imagination. He
loved Indian arrow-heads, for they were fragments of a mysterious
past; he loved twilight effects and midnight walks, for the
mystery of night challenged him and brought him nearer to the
cosmic and the infinite:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have returned to the woods and ... spent the hours of midnight
fishing from a boat by moonlight, serenaded by owls and foxes, and
hearing, from time to time, the creaking note of some unknown bird
close at hand. These experiences were very memorable and valuable
to me&mdash;anchored in forty feet of water, and twenty or thirty rods
from the shore ... communicating by a long flaxen line with mysterious
nocturnal fishes which had their dwelling forty feet below, or sometimes
dragging sixty feet of line about the pond as I drifted in the
gentle night breeze, now and then feeling a slight vibration along it,
indicative of some life prowling about its extremity, of dull uncertain
blundering purpose there.... It was very queer, especially in dark
nights, when your thoughts had wandered to vast and cosmogonal
themes in other spheres, to feel this faint jerk which came ... to link
you to Nature again.</p></blockquote>

<p>Burroughs, like most scientists, slept at night. His observations
were made by day: there is hardly a night scene in all
his works; but Thoreau abounds in night scenes as much even
as Novalis or Longfellow. He was at heart a mystic and he
viewed Nature always from mystic standpoints. In "Night and
Moonlight" he writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Is not the midnight like Central Africa to most of us? Are we not
tempted to explore it&mdash;to penetrate to the shores of its lake Tchad,
and discover the sources of the Nile, perchance the Mountains of the
Moon? Who knows what fertility and beauty, moral and natural, are
there to be found? In the Mountains of the Moon, in the Central
Africa of the night, there is where all Niles have their hidden heads.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was to discover these Mountains of the Moon, these mysterious
sources of the Nile, forever so far away and yet forever so
near, that Thoreau went to Nature. He went not to gather and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
to classify facts; he went to satisfy his soul. Burroughs is inclined
to wonder and even laugh because of the many times he
speaks of hearing the voice of unknown birds. To Burroughs
the forest contained no unknown birds; to Thoreau the forest
was valuable only because it <i>did</i> contain unknown birds. His
straining for hidden melodies, his striving for deeper meanings,
his dreaming of Mountains of the Moon that might become visible
at any moment just beyond the horizon&mdash;it is in these things that
he differs from all other nature writers. He was not a reporter;
he was a prophet. "My profession is always to be on the alert,
to find God in nature, to know His lurking places, to attend all
the oratorios, the operas in nature. Shall I not have words as
fresh as my thought? Shall I use any other man's word?"</p>

<p>To him Nature was of value only as it furnished message for
humanity. "A fact," he declared, "must be the vehicle of some
humanity in order to interest us." He went to Nature for tonic,
not for fact; he sought only truth and freedom and spontaneousness
of soul. He had no desire to write a botany, or an ornithology;
rather would he learn of Nature the fundamentals of human
living. "I went into the woods because I wished to live deliberately,
to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could
not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover
that I had not lived." Burroughs went into the woods to
know and to make others to know, Thoreau went in to think and
to feel; Burroughs was a naturalist, Thoreau a <i>super</i>naturalist.</p>

<p>Thoreau belongs completely to the later period: he is as thoroughly
of American soil as even Mark Twain or Lincoln or
Whitman. While Longfellow and Lowell, Taylor and Aldrich,
and the rest of their school were looking eagerly to Europe,
Thoreau was completely engrossed with his own land. "No truer
American ever existed than Thoreau," wrote Emerson in his
essay. "His preference of his country and condition was
genuine, and his aversion from English and European manners
and tastes almost reached contempt.... He wished to go to
Oregon, not to London." It was this new-worldness, this freshness,
this originality that made him the man of the new era. He
went always to the sources; his work is redolent at every point
of American soil. His images, his illustrations, his subject matter,
all are American. His style, after he had outgrown an early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
fondness for Carlyle, is peculiarly his own, wonderfully simple
and limpid and individual. Often it flows like poetry:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The sun is near setting away beyond Fair Haven. A bewitching
stillness reigns through all the woodland, and over all the snowclad
landscape. Indeed, the winter day in the woods or fields has commonly
the stillness of twilight. The pond is perfectly smooth and full of
light. I hear only the strokes of a lingering woodchopper at a distance
and the melodious hooting of an owl.&mdash;December 9, 1856.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">And what is this but poetry?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>On the morning when the wild geese go over, I, too, feel the migratory
instinct strong within me, and anticipate the breaking up of winter.
If I yielded to this impulse, it would surely guide me to summer
haunts. This indefinite restlessness and fluttering on the perch no
doubt prophesy the final migration of souls out of nature to a serener
summer, in long harrows and waving lines, in the spring weather, over
that fair uplands and fertile Elysian meadows, winging their way at
evening, and seeking a resting place with loud cackling and uproar.&mdash;January
29, 1859.</p></blockquote>

<p>Thoreau was one of the most tonic forces of the later period.
His inspiration and his spirit filled all the later school of Nature
writers. One cannot read him long, especially in his later and
more unconscious work, and find oneself unmoved. He inspires
to action, to restlessness of soul. Take an entry like that of January
7, 1857, made during one of the most tumultuous of New
England winter storms: "It is bitter cold, with a cutting N.W.
wind.... All animate things are reduced to their lowest terms.
This is the fifth day of cold, blowing weather," and so on and on
till one fairly hears the roaring of the storm. Yet, despite the
blast and the piercing cold, Thoreau goes out for his walk as usual
and battles with the elements through miles of snow-smothered
wilderness. "There is nothing so sanative, so poetic, as a walk
in the woods and fields even now, when I meet none abroad
for pleasure. Nothing so inspires me, and excites such serene
and profitable thought." His battle with the wind and the cold
and the wilderness grips us as we read. We too would rush into
the storm and breast it and exult in it; we too would walk with
Nature under the open skies, in the broad, wholesome places, and
view the problems of life with serene soul. It is this dynamic
element of Thoreau that has given him his following. He is
sincere, he is working from the impulses of his soul, he is genuine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
He is not a scientist: he is a poet and a seer. When we
walk with Burroughs, we see as with new eyes; when with Thoreau,
we feel. With Burroughs we learn of signs and seasons
and traits; with Thoreau we find ourselves straining ears to catch
the deeper harmonies, the mysterious soul of Nature, that somehow
we feel to be intertwined eternally with the soul of man.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The transition from Thoreau to John Burroughs was through
Thomas Wentworth Higginson. Wilson Flagg (1805&ndash;1884) had
contributed to the early volumes of the <i>Atlantic</i> a series of bird
studies Irving-like in atmosphere and sentiment, but he had made
little impression. He was too literary, too much the child of
the mid century. In his study of the owl, for instance, he could
write: "I will not enter into a speculation concerning the nature
and origin of those agreeable emotions which are so generally
produced by the sight of objects that suggest the ideas of decay
and desolation. It is happy for us, that, by the alchemy of
poetry, we are able to turn some of our misfortunes into sources
of melancholy pleasure, after the poignancy of grief has been
assuaged by time," and so on and on till he got to midnight and
the owl. It is a literary effort. There is lack of sincerity in it:
the author is thinking too exclusively of his reader. The difference
between it and a passage from Thoreau is the difference
between a reverie in the study and a battle in the woods. Higginson,
who followed in the <i>Atlantic</i> with "April Days," "The
Life of Birds," and the other studies which he issued as
<i>Out-Door Papers</i> in 1863, avoided the over-literary element on
one hand and the over-scientific on the other and so became the
first of what may be called the modern school of nature writers.</p>

<p>As we read Higginson's book to-day we find style and method
curiously familiar. For the first time in American literature we
have that chatty, anecdotal, half-scientific, half-sentimental treatment
of out-door things that soon was to become so common.
It is difficult to persuade oneself that a paper like "The Life of
Birds," for instance, was not written by the Burroughs of the
earlier period. <i>Out-Door Papers</i> and <i>Wake-Robin</i> are pitched in
the same key. Who could be positive of the authorship of a
fragment like this, were not Higginson's name appended:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>To a great extent, birds follow the opening foliage northward, and
flee from its fading, south; they must keep near the food on which
they live, and secure due shelter for their eggs. Our earliest visitors
shrink from trusting the bare trees with their nests; the song-sparrow
seeks the ground; the blue-bird finds a box or hole somewhere; the red-wing
haunts the marshy thickets, safer in the spring than at any other
season; and even the sociable robin prefers a pine-tree to an apple-tree,
if resolved to begin housekeeping prematurely. The movements
of birds are chiefly timed by the advance of vegetation; and the thing
most thoroughly surprising about them is not the general fact of the
change of latitude, but their accuracy in hitting the precise locality.
That the same cat-bird should find its way back, every spring, to almost
the same branch of yonder larch-tree&mdash;that is the thing astonishing
to me.</p></blockquote>

<p>The most notable thing, however, about Higginson's out-door
papers was their ringing call for a return to reality. It was
he who more than any one else created interest in Thoreau; and
it was he who first gained attention with the cry, "Back to nature."
"The American temperament," he declared, "needs at
this moment nothing so much as that wholesome training of
semi-rural life which reared Hampden and Cromwell to assume
at one grasp the sovereignty of England.... The little I have
gained from colleges and libraries has certainly not worn so well
as the little I learned in childhood of the habits of plant, bird,
and insect.... Our American life still needs, beyond all things
else, the more habitual cultivation of out-door habits.... The
more bent any man is on action, the more profoundly he needs
the calm lessons of Nature to preserve his equilibrium." To the
new generation of writers he flung a challenge: "Thoreau
camps down by Walden Pond and shows us that absolutely nothing
in Nature has ever yet been described&mdash;not a bird or a berry of
the woods, not a drop of water, not a spicula of ice, nor winter,
nor summer, nor sun, nor star." And again, "What do we know,
for instance, of the local distribution of our birds? I remember
that in my latest conversation with Thoreau last December, he
mentioned most remarkable facts in this department, which had
fallen under his unerring eyes."</p>

<p>This was published in the <i>Atlantic</i>, September, 1862. In
May, 1865, as if in answer to the challenge, there appeared
in the same magazine John Burroughs's "With the Birds," a
paper which he had written two years before. The army
life of Higginson and later his humanitarian work in many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
fields put an end to his out-door writings, but not to his influence.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>John Burroughs was born on a farm in Roxbury, New York,
just below the Otsego County made famous by Cooper and the
Leather-stocking Tales. His boyhood until he was seventeen
"was mainly occupied," to quote his own words, "with farm
work in the summer, and with a little study, offset by much
hunting and trapping of wild animals in winter." One must
study this boyhood if one is to understand the man's work:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>From childhood I was familiar with the homely facts of the barn,
and of cattle and horses; the sugar-making in the maple woods in
early spring; the work of the corn-field, hay-field, potato-field; the
delicious fall months with their pigeon and squirrel shootings; threshing
of buckwheat, gathering of apples, and burning of fallows; in
short, everything that smacked of, and led to, the open air and its exhilarations.
I belonged, as I may say, to them; and my substance and
taste, as they grew, assimilated them as truly as my body did its food.
I loved a few books much; but I loved Nature, in all those material
examples and subtle expressions, with a love passing all the books of
the <span class="locked">world.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>Of schooling he had little. "I was born," he once wrote, "of
and among people who neither read books nor cared for them,
and my closest associations since have been alien to literature
and art." The usual winter term in his native district, a year
or two in academy courses after he was seventeen&mdash;that was the
extent of his formal education. At twenty he was married, at
twenty-seven, after having drifted about as a school teacher, he
settled at Washington in a position in the Treasury Department
that held him closely for nine years.</p>

<p>It was a period of self-discipline. His intellectual life had
been awakened by Emerson, and he had followed him into wide
fields. He read enormously, he studied languages, he trained
himself with models of English style. His love of the country,
legacy of the boyhood which he never outgrew, impelled him to
a systematic study of ornithology. Birds were his avocation, his
enthusiasm; by and by they were to become his vocation.</p>

<p>In 1861, when he was twenty-four, he came for the first time in
contact with <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, and it aroused him like a vision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>It produced the impression upon me in my moral consciousness that
actual Nature did in her material forms and shows; ... I shall never
forget the strange delight I had from the following passage, as we sat
there on the sunlit border of an autumn forest:</p>

<p class="hang">I lie abstracted, and hear beautiful tales of things, and the reasons of things;</p>
<p class="hang">They are so beautiful, I nudge myself to listen.</p>
<p class="hang">I cannot say to any person what I hear&mdash;I cannot say it to myself&mdash;it is very wonderful;</p>
<p class="hang">It is no small matter, this round and delicious globe, moving so exactly in its orbit forever and ever, without one jolt, or the untruth of a single second;</p>
<p class="hang">I do not think it was made in six days, nor in ten thousand years, nor in ten billions of years;</p>
<p class="hang">Nor planned and built one thing after another, as an architect plans and builds a house.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="in0">It was the touch that he needed. There was in him a strain of
wildness even as in Thoreau, an almost feminine shrinking from
the crowd, a thinking of Nature as something apart from man, a
retreat and an antidote; Whitman added the human element,
the sympathetic touch, the sense of the value of man.</p>

<p>Burroughs's first work appeared that same year in the New
York <i>Leader</i>, a series of papers under the heading "From the
Back Country"&mdash;crude things compared with Higginson's polished
work, yet filled with a genuineness and a freshness that
were notable. All of his earlier sketches were the work of a
careful observer who wrote from sheer love of Nature. Moreover,
they were the work of a dreamer and a poet. As the years
took him farther from that marvelous boyhood, the light upon it
grew softer and more golden. He dreamed of it in the spring
when the bluebird called and the high-hole; he dreamed of it on
his walks in the city suburbs when the swallows greeted him and
the warblers. His <i>Atlantic</i> paper "With the Birds," now the
first chapter of his published works, begins with the sentence,
now suppressed, "Not in the spirit of exact science, but rather
with the freedom of love and old acquaintance, would I celebrate
some of the minstrels of the field and forest." And years
later, when he wrote the general introduction to his works, he
could say:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>My first book, <i>Wake-Robin</i>, was written while I was a government
clerk in Washington. It enabled me to live over again the days I had
passed with the birds and in the scenes of my youth. I wrote the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
book sitting at a desk in front of an iron wall. I was keeper of a
vault in which many millions of bank notes were stored. During my
long periods of leisure I took refuge in my pen. How my mind reacted
from the iron wall in front of me and sought solace in memories
of the birds and of summer fields and woods! Most of the chapters
of <i>Winter Sunshine</i> were written at the same desk. The sunshine there
referred to is of a richer quality than is found in New York and
New England.</p></blockquote>

<p>That was the secret of the early work of John Burroughs:
to him Nature was a part of his boyhood, with boyhood's light
upon it. He dreamed of her when the city homesickness was
upon him and when he wrote of her he wrote from a full heart.
He felt every line of it; the light that plays over it is indeed
of "richer quality" than is found over any actual hills. A
part of his early popularity came undoubtedly from the
sentiment which he freely mingled with his studies of field and
woodland.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There is something almost pathetic in the fact that the birds remain
forever the same. You grow old, your friends die or remove to distant
lands, events sweep on and all things are changed. Yet there in your
garden or orchard are the birds of your boyhood, the same notes, the
same calls, and, to all intents and purposes, the identical birds endowed
with perennial youth. The swallows, that built so far out of your
reach beneath the eaves of your father's barn, the same ones now squeak
and chatter beneath the eaves of your barn. The warblers and shy
wood birds you pursued with such glee ever so many summers ago,
and whose names you taught to some beloved youth who now, perchance,
sleeps amid his native hills, no marks of time or change cling
to them; and when you walk out to the strange woods, there they
are, mocking you with their ever renewed and joyous youth. The call
of the high-holes, the whistle of the quail, the strong piercing note of
the meadow lark, the drumming of the grouse&mdash;how these sounds ignore
the years, and strike on the ear with the melody of that springtime
when the world was young, and life was all holiday and <span class="locked">romance.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>The twenty years following his first <i>Atlantic</i> paper were the
years of his professional life. He left his clerkship at Washington
in 1873 to become a national bank inspector, and until 1884,
when he finally retired to rural life, he was busy with his duties
as receiver of broken banks, examiner of accounts, and financial
expert. During the two decades he published his most distinctive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
nature volumes: <i>Wake-Robin</i>, <i>Winter Sunshine</i>, <i>Birds and
Poets</i>, <i>Locusts and Wild Honey</i>, and <i>Pepacton</i>, a small output
for a man between the years of twenty-six and forty-six, yet one
that is significant. Not a page of it had been written in haste,
not a page that his later hand had found it necessary to revise.
The primal freshness of youth is upon the books; they are as full
of vitality and sweetness as a spring morning. Doubtless they
are all the better for being the enthusiasms of hours stolen from
a dry profession. It is tonic to read them. They are never at
fault either in fact or in influence; they are the work of a trained
observer, a scientist indeed, yet one who has gone to Nature like a
priest to the holy of holies with the glow in his heart and the light
on his face.</p>

<p>During the following decade, or, more exactly, the period between
1884 and 1894, he added four more books, three of them,
<i>Fresh Fields</i>, <i>Signs and Seasons</i>, and <i>Riverby</i>, devoted to Nature,
though with more and more of the coldly scientific spirit.
These with the five earlier volumes stand alone as Burroughs's
contribution to the field that he has made peculiarly his own.
They contain his freshest and most spontaneous work.</p>

<p>To read these volumes is like going out ourselves into the
forest with an expert guide who sees everything and who has at
his command an unlimited store of anecdote and chatty reminiscence
of birds and animals and even plants. To Burroughs,
Nature was sufficient in herself. He loved her for the feelings
she could arouse within him, for the recollections she could stir
of the springtime of his life, for the beauty and the harmony
that everywhere he found, and for the elemental laws that he
saw on all sides at work and that stirred his curiosity. He had
no desire to study Nature to secure evidences of a governing
personality. He would draw no moral and offer no solutions of
the problem of good and evil. Of the fortunes of the spirit of
man he cared but little; as for himself, serene, he would fold his
hands and wait. He was no mystic like Thoreau, listening for
higher harmonies and peering eagerly beyond every headland
to discover perchance the sources of the Nile. Upon him there
was no necessity save to observe, to record, to discover new
phenomena, to enlarge the store of facts, to walk flat-footed upon
the material earth and observe the working of the physical mechanics
about him and to teach others to observe them and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
enjoy them. To appreciate the difference between Burroughs
and Thoreau one has but to read them side by side. For instance,
on March 21, 1853, Thoreau makes this entry:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>As I was rising this crowning road, just beyond the old lime kiln,
there leaked into my open ear the first peep of a hyla from some far
pool ... a note or two which scarcely rends the air, does no violence
to the zephyr, but yet leaks through all obstacles and far over the
downs to the ear of the listening naturalist, as it were the first faint
cry of the new-born year, notwithstanding the notes of birds. Where
so long I have heard the prattling and moaning of the wind, what
means this tenser, far-piercing sound?</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Burroughs writes of the same subject in this way:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>From what fact or event shall we really date the beginning of
spring? The little piping frogs usually furnish a good starting point.
One spring I heard the first note on the 6th of April; the next on
the 27th of February; but in reality the latter season was only about
two weeks earlier than the former.... The little piper will sometimes
climb a bullrush to which he clings like a sailor to a mast, and
send forth his shrill call. There is a Southern species, heard when
you have reached the Potomac, whose note is far more harsh and
crackling. To stand on the verge of a swamp vocal with these, pains
and stuns the ear.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Then in a foot-note:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Southern species is called the green hyla. I have since heard
them in my neighborhood on the Hudson.</p></blockquote>

<p>Never was there writer who kept his feet more firmly on solid
earth. He takes nothing for granted; he is satisfied only with
the testimony of the senses, and his own senses. Everything&mdash;example,
allusion, figure of speech, subject and predicate&mdash;comes
from him in the concrete. Everything is specific, localized,
dated. He was in accord with his era that demanded only reality.
It is the task of the writer, he declared, "to pierce through
our callousness and indifference and give us fresh impressions of
things as they really are."</p>

<p>How permanent is such work? How valuable is it? Is Nature
then a thing simply to be observed and classified and reduced
to formulæ? To determine the average day on which the bluebird
comes, or the wild geese fly, or the hyla calls, is there virtue
in that? To Burroughs, Nature was a thing to be observed accurately
for new facts to add to the known. Of Thoreau he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
wrote: "Ten years of persistent spying and inspecting of Nature
and no new thing found out." Do we ask of the poet and
the seer simply for mere new material phenomena found out to
add to our science? The supreme test that must come at last to
all literature is the question: How much of human life is there
in it? How much "Thus saith the Lord"? Who seeks for
material things with eyes, however keen, and dreams of no
sources of the Nile, no vision that may come perchance from supernatural
power latent in bird and leaf and tendril, is a scientist,
however charming he make his subject or however sympathetic
be his attitude. Judged by such a standard, Burroughs falls
short, far short of a place with the highest. He must decrease,
while Thoreau increases. He must be placed at last among the
scientists who have added facts and laws, while Thoreau is seated
with the poets and the prophets.</p>

<p>But though he be thus without vision and without message,
save as an invitation to come to material Nature and learn to
observe is a message, Burroughs has a charm of manner and a
picturesqueness of material that are to be found in few other
writers of the period. His power lies in his simplicity and his
sincerity. He is more familiar with his reader than Thoreau.
He is never literary, never affected; he talks in the most natural
way in the world; he tells story after story in the most artless
way of homely little happenings that have passed under his own
eye, and so charming is his talk that we surrender ourselves like
children to listen as long as he will. When we read Thoreau
we are always conscious of Thoreau. His epithets, his distinction
of phrase, his sudden glimpses, his unexpected turns and
climaxes, his humor, for in spite of Lowell's dictum, he is full
of humor, keep us constantly in the presence of literature; but
with Burroughs we are conscious of nothing save the birds and
the season and the fields. We are walking with a delightful
companion who knows everything and who points out new wonders
at every step.</p>

<p>The poetry of Burroughs faded more and more from his work
with every book, and the spirit of the scientist, of the trained
observer impatient of everything not demonstrable by the senses,
grew upon him, until at length it took full control and expressed
itself as criticism, as scientific controversy, and as philosophical
discussion. <i>Riverby</i>, 1894, with its prefatory note stating that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
the volume was "probably my last collection of out-of-door papers,"
marks the point of division between the two periods. If
we follow the Riverside edition, at present [1914] the definitive
canon, eight books preceded <i>Riverby</i> and eight followed it. The
groups are not homogeneous; it is not to be gathered that on a
certain date Burroughs abandoned one form of essay and devoted
himself exclusively to another, but it is true that the work
of his last period is prevailingly scientific and critical. His
<i>Indoor Studies</i>, 1889, <i>Whitman, a Study, and Literary Values</i>
are as distinctively works of literary criticism as Arnold's <i>Essays
in Criticism</i>; his <i>Light of Day</i> discusses religion from the
standpoint of the scientist; his <i>Ways of Nature</i> is scientific controversy;
and his <i>Time and Change</i> and <i>The Summit of the Years</i>
are philosophy.</p>

<p>It is in this second period that Burroughs has done his most
distinctive work, though not perhaps his most spontaneous and
delightful. By temperament and training he is a critic, a scientific
critic, an analyzer and comparer. Only men of positive
character, original forces, attract him: Emerson and Whitman,
and later Wordsworth, Carlyle, and Arnold, men who molded the
intellectual life of their age. His first published book had been
a critical study, <i>Notes on Walt Whitman</i>, 1867, a work the most
wonderful in many ways of his whole output. It came at a
critical moment, in those pregnant closing years of the sixties,
and it struck clear and full the note of the new period. Burroughs's
later studies of Whitman are more finished and more
mature than this never-republished volume, but they lack its
clarion quality. It is more than a defense and an explanation
of Whitman: it is a call to higher levels in literature and art, a
call for a new definition of poetry, a condemnation of that softness
and honey sweetness of song that had lured to weakness
poets like Taylor and Stoddard. Poetry henceforth must be
more than mere beauty for beauty's sake: it must have a message;
it must come burning from a man's soul; it must thrill with human
life.</p>

<p>And it is here that Burroughs stands as a dominating figure.
He was the first of American critics to insist without compromise
that poetry is poetry only when it is the voice of life&mdash;genuine,
spontaneous, inevitable. "How rare," he complained in later
years, "are real poems&mdash;poems that spring from real feeling, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
real throb of emotion, and not from a mere surface itching for expression."
This has been the key to all his criticism: literature is
life, the voicing of a man's soul. Moreover, it is a voicing of the
national life, the expression of a nation's soul:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>All the great imaginative writers of our century have felt, more
or less, the stir and fever of the century, and have been its priests and
prophets. The lesser poets have not felt these things. Had Poe been
greater or broader he would have felt them, so would Longfellow.
Neither went deep enough to touch the formative currents of our
social or religious or national life. In the past the great artist has
always been at ease in Zion; in our own day only the lesser artists
are at ease, unless we except Whitman, a man of unshaken faith, who
is absolutely optimistic, and whose joy and serenity come from the
breadth of his vision and the depth and universality of his <span class="locked">sympathies.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>The literary criticism of Burroughs&mdash;four volumes of it in
the final edition, or nearly one-fourth of his whole output&mdash;may
be classed with the sanest and most illuminating critical work in
American literature. Lowell's criticism, brilliant as it is at
times, is overloaded with learning. He belongs to the school of
the early reviewers, ponderous and discursive. He makes use of
one-third of his space in his essay on Thoreau before he even
alludes to Thoreau. He is self-conscious, and self-satisfied; he
poses before his reader and enjoys the sensation caused by his
brilliant hit after hit. Stedman, too, is often more literary
than scientific. Often he uses epithet and phrase that have
nothing to commend them save their prettiness, their affectation
of the odd or the antique. He is an appreciator of literature
rather than critic in the modern sense. Burroughs, however,
is always simple and direct. He is a scientific critic who
compares and classifies and seeks causes and effects. He works
not on the surface but always in the deeper currents and always
with the positive forces, those writers who have turned the direction
of the literature and the thinking of their generation. In
marked contrast with Stedman, he can place Longfellow and
Landor among the minor singers: "Their sympathies were
mainly outside their country and their times." He demands
that the poet have a message for his age. He says of Emerson:
"Emerson is a power because he partakes of a great spiritual
and intellectual movement of his times; he is unequivocally of
to-day and New England."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
Burroughs's nature essays, charming as they are and full as
they are of a delightful personality, will be superseded by others
as careful and as charming; Burroughs's criticism was the voice
of an era, and it will stand with the era. It was in his later
years that he put forth his real message.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>John Burroughs is the historian of a small area; he has the
home instinct, the hereditary farmer's love for his own fields
and woods, and the haunts of his childhood. He is contemplative,
tranquil, unassertive. John Muir was restless, fervid,
Scotch by temperament as by birth, the very opposite of Burroughs.
He was telescopic, not microscopic; his units were
glaciers and Yosemites, Sierras and Gardens of the Gods.</p>

<p>The childhood of Muir was broken at eleven by the migration
of his family from their native Scotland to the wilderness of
Wisconsin, near the Fox River. After a boyhood in what literally
was a new world to him, he started on his wanderings.
By accident he found himself in the University of Wisconsin,
where he studied for four years, the first author of note to be
connected with the new state college movement, the democratizing
of education. He pursued no regular course, but devoted himself
to chemistry, botany, and other natural sciences that interested
him, and then, to quote his own words, "wandered away on a
glorious botanical and geological excursion, which has lasted
nearly fifty years and is not yet completed, always happy and
free, poor and rich, without thought of a diploma, of making
a name, urged on and on through endless, inspiring, Godful
beauty."</p>

<p>First he went to Florida, walking all the way, and sleeping on
the ground wherever night overtook him; then he crossed to
Cuba, with visions of South America and the Amazon beyond;
but malarial fever, caused by sleeping on swampy ground, turned
him away from the tropics toward California, where he arrived
in 1868. The tremendous scenery of this west coast, those American
Alps edging a continent from the Sierras to the Alaskan
glaciers, so gripped his imagination and held him that he forgot
everything save to look and wonder and worship. For years he
explored the region, living months at a time in the forests of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
Yosemite, in the wild Alpine gardens and glacial meadows of
the Sierra, in passes and cañons, moving as far north as Alaska,
where he was the first to see the great glacier now called by his
name, sleeping where night overtook him, disdaining blanket or
shelter, and returning to civilization only when driven by necessity.
After years of such wandering he became as familiar with
the mighty region, the tremendous western wall of a continent,
as Thoreau was with Concord or Burroughs was with the banks
of the Pepacton.</p>

<p>Unlike Burroughs, Muir sent down no roots during his earlier
formative period; he was a man without a country, anchored to
no past, a soul unsatisfied, restless, bursting eagerly into untrodden
areas, as hungry of heart as Thoreau, but with none of
Thoreau's provincialism and transcendental theories. In 1869
in the Big Tuolumne Meadows he was told of a marvelous, but
dangerous, region beyond, and his account of the episode illumines
him as with a flash-light:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Recognizing the unsatisfiable longings of my Scotch Highland instincts,
he threw out some hints concerning Bloody Cañon, and advised
me to explore it. "I have never seen it myself," he said, "for
I never was so unfortunate as to pass that way. But I have heard
many a strange story about it, and I warrant you will at least find
it wild enough." Next day I made up a bundle of bread, tied my
note-book to my belt, and strode away in the bracing air, full of
eager, indefinite hope.</p></blockquote>

<p>His first out-of-doors article, a paper on the Yosemite glaciers,
was published in the New York <i>Tribune</i> in 1871. Later he contributed
to the <i>Overland Monthly</i>, to <i>Harper's</i>, and <i>Scribner's
Monthly</i> articles that have in them an atmosphere unique in literature.
What sweep and freedom, what vastness of scale, what
abysses and gulfs, what wildernesses of peaks. It is like sweeping
over a continent in a balloon. One is ever in the vast places:
one thrills with the author's own excitement:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>How boundless the day seems as we revel in these storm-beaten
sky-gardens amidst so vast a congregation of onlooking mountains....
From garden to garden, ridge to ridge, I drifted enchanted, now
on my knees gazing into the face of a daisy, now climbing again and
again among the purple and azure flowers of the hemlocks, now down
among the treasuries of the snow, or gazing afar over domes and
peaks, lakes and woods, and the billowy glaciated fields of the upper
Tuolumne, and trying to sketch them. In the midst of such beauty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
pierced with its rays, one's body is all a tingling palate. Who
wouldn't be a mountaineer! Up here all the world's prizes seem
nothing.&mdash;July 26, 1869.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>I chose a camping ground on the brink of one of the lakes, where
a thicket of hemlock spruce sheltered me from the night wind. Then
after making a tin cupful of tea, I sat by my campfire reflecting on
the grandeur and significance of the glacial records I had seen. As
the night advanced, the mighty rock-walls of my mountain mansion
seemed to come nearer, while the starry sky in glorious brightness
stretched across like a ceiling from wall to wall, and fitted closely
down into all the spiky irregularities of the summits. Then, after a
long fireside rest, and a glance at my note-book, I cut a few leafy
branches for a bed, and fell into the clear, death-like sleep of the
mountaineer.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>No pain here, no dull empty hours, no fear of the past, no fear of
the future. These blessed mountains are so compactly filled with
God's beauty, no petty personal hope or experience has room to be....
Perched like a fly on this Yosemite dome, I gaze and sketch and
bask, oftentimes settling down into dumb admiration without definite
hope of ever learning much, yet with the longing, unresisting effort that
lies at the door of hope, humbly prostrate before the vast display of
God's power, and eager to offer self-denial and renunciation with eternal
toil to learn any lesson in the divine manuscript.&mdash;July 20, 1869.</p></blockquote>

<p>To read Muir is to be in the presence not of a tranquil, chatty
companion like Burroughs, who saunters leisurely along the
spring meadows listening for the birds just arrived the night
before and comparing the dates of the hyla's first cry; it is rather
to be with a tempestuous soul whose units are storms and mountain
ranges and mighty glacial moraines, who strides excitedly
along the bare tops of ragged peaks and rejoices in their vastness
and awfulness, who cries, "Come with me along the glaciers
and see God making landscapes!" One gets at the heart of Muir
in an episode like this, the description of a terrific storm in the
Yuba region in December, 1874:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The force of the gale was such that the most steadfast monarch of
them all rocked down to its roots with a motion plainly perceptible
when one leaned against it. Nature was holding high festival, and
every fiber of the most rigid giants thrilled with glad excitement. I
drifted on through the midst of this passionate music and motion
across many a glen, from ridge to ridge; often falling in the lee of a
rock for shelter, or to gaze and listen. Even when the glad anthem
had swelled to its highest pitch, I could distinctly hear the varying
tones of individual trees&mdash;spruce, and fir, and pine, and leafless oak.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
... Toward midday, after a long, tingling scramble through copses
of hazel and ceanothus, I gained the summit of the highest ridge in
the neighborhood; and then it occurred to me that it would be a fine
thing to climb one of the trees to obtain a wider outlook and get my
ear close to the Æolian music of its topmost needles.... Being accustomed
to climb trees in making botanical studies, I experienced no
difficulty in reaching the top of this one, and never before did I enjoy
so noble an exhilaration of motion. The slender tops fairly flapped
and swished in the passionate torrent, bending and swirling backward
and forward, round and round, tracing indescribable combinations of
vertical and horizontal curves, while I clung with muscles firm braced,
like a bobolink on a reed.</p></blockquote>

<p>He had more humor than Burroughs, more even than Thoreau,
a sly Scotch drollery that was never boisterous, never cynical.
In the Bloody Cañon he meets the Mono Indians and finds little
in them that is romantic:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The dirt on their faces was fairly stratified and seemed so ancient
in some places and so undisturbed as almost to possess a geological
significance. The older faces were, moreover, strangely blurred and
divided into sections by furrows that looked like cleavage joints, suggesting
exposure in a castaway condition on the mountains for ages.
Viewed at a little distance they appeared as mere dirt specks on the
landscape.</p></blockquote>

<p>Like Thoreau, he was a mystic and a poet. He inherited mysticism
with his Scotch blood as he inherited wildness and the love
of freedom. He was not a mere naturalist, a mere scientist bent
only on facts and laws: he was a searcher after God, even as
Thoreau. As one reads him, one feels one's soul expanding,
one's horizons widening, one's hands reaching out for the infinite.
The message of Muir is compelling and eager:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Next to the light of the dawn on high mountain-tops, the alpenglow
is the most impressive of all the terrestrial manifestations of God;...
stay on this good fire mountain and spend the night among the
stars. Watch their glorious bloom until dawn, and get one more baptism
of light. Then, with fresh heart, go down to your work, and
whatever your fate, under whatever ignorance or knowledge you may
afterwards chance to suffer, you will remember these fine, wild views,
and look back with joy.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">And again after his joyous study of the water ouzel, a prose
lyric, rapturous and infectious, he cries:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And so I might go on, writing words, words, words; but to what
purpose? Go see him and love him, and through him as through a
window look into Nature's warm heart.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
The output of Muir, especially of books, has been small. To
one who cares nothing for money and who is indifferent to fame,
it is hard to offer inducements. He wrote only to please himself;
he would not be commanded or bribed or begged, for why
should one write words when the Sierras are in bloom and the
winds are calling in the upper peaks? The public at large
knows little of him, compared with what it knows of Burroughs
or even of Thoreau. His influence, therefore, has been small.
Though he had published many magazine articles, it was not
until 1894 that he published <i>The Mountains of California</i>, his
first book. <i>Our National Parks</i> came in 1901, and <i>My First
Summer in the Sierra</i> in 1911. The last is Muir's journal, kept
on the spot, full of the thrill and the freshness of the original day.
If it be a sample of the journal which we have reason to believe
that he kept with Thoreau-like thoroughness almost to the time
of his death&mdash;he died in December, 1914&mdash;the best work of John
Muir may even yet be in store.</p>

<p>Muir was more gentle than Thoreau or Burroughs, and more
sympathetic with everything alive in the wild places which he
loved. Unlike Burroughs, he has named the birds without a gun,
and, unlike Thoreau, he has refused to kill even fish or rattlesnakes.
He could look on even the repulsive lizards of his region,
some of them veritable monsters in size and hideousness, with
real affection:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Small fellow-mortals, gentle and guileless, they are easily tamed,
and have beautiful eyes, expressing the clearest innocence, so that,
in spite of prejudices brought from cool, lizardless countries, one must
soon learn to like them. Even the horned toad of the plains and foothills,
called horrid, is mild and gentle, with charming eyes, and so are
the snake-like species found in the underbrush of the lower forests....
You will surely learn to like them, not only the bright ones, gorgeous
as the rainbow, but the little ones, gray as lichened granite, and
scarcely bigger than grasshoppers; and they will teach you that scales
may cover as fine a nature as hair or feather or anything tailored.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">And there is no more sympathetic, interpretative study among
all the work of the nature-writers than his characterization of
the Douglas squirrel of the Western mountains:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>One never tires of this bright chip of Nature, this brave little voice
crying in the wilderness, observing his many works and ways, and
listening to his curious language. His musical, piney gossip is savory
to the ear as balsam to the palate; and though he has not exactly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
gift of song, some of his notes are sweet as those of a linnet&mdash;almost
flute-like in softness; while others prick and tingle like thistles. He
is the mocking-bird of squirrels, pouring forth mixed chatter and song
like a perennial fountain, barking like a dog, screaming like a hawk,
whistling like blackbirds and sparrows; while in bluff, audacious
noisiness he is a jay.</p></blockquote>

<p>Emerson visited Muir during his trip to the West Coast,
climbed the precarious ladder that led to his room in the Yosemite
sawmill, and passed a memorable afternoon. "He is more
wonderful than Thoreau," he said, and he tried long to induce
him to leave the mountains for the East, and to live in the midst
of men. But to Muir the leaving of the Yosemite and the Sierra
was like leaving God Himself. To him the city was the place
of unnatural burdens, of money that dulls and kills the finest
things of the soul, of separation from all that is really vital in the
life of man.</p>

<p>His style is marked by vividness and fervid power. He makes
a scene stand out with sharpness. He is original; there are in his
work no traces of other writings save those of the Bible, with
which he was saturated, and at rare intervals of Thoreau. Often
there is a rhetorical ring to his page, a resonant fullness of tone
that can be described only by the word eloquent. In passages
describing storm or mountain majesty there is a thrill, an excitement,
that are infectious. The prose of John Muir may be
summed up as sincere and vigorous, without trace of self-consciousness
or of straining for effect. Few writers of any period
of American literature have within their work more elements of
promise as they go down to the generations to come.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Beginning with the late sixties, out-of-door themes more and
more took possession of American literature. Burroughs was
only one in an increasing throng of writers; he was the best
known and most stimulating, and soon, therefore, the leader and
inspirer. The mid-nineteenth century had been effeminate in
the bulk of its literary product; it had been a thing of indoors
and of books: the new after-the-war spirit was masculine even
at times to coarseness and brutality. Maurice Thompson
(1844&ndash;1901), one of the earliest of the new period, perceived
the bent of the age with clearness. "We are nothing better than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
refined and enlightened savages," he wrote in 1878. "The wild
side of the prism of humanity still offers its pleasures to us....
Sport, by which is meant pleasant physical and mental exercise
combined&mdash;play in the best sense&mdash;is a requirement of this
wild element, this glossed over heathen side of our being, and
the bow is its natural <span class="locked">implement."<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></span> It was the apology of the
old school for the new era of sport. Thompson would direct
these heathen energies toward archery, since it was a sport that
appealed to the imagination and that took its devotees into the
forests and the swamps, but there was no directing of the resurging
forces. Baseball and football sprang up in the seventies and
grew swiftly into hitherto unheard-of proportions. Yachting,
camping, mountaineering, summer tramping in the woods and
the borders of civilization swiftly became popular. The Adirondacks
and the Maine forests and the White Mountains sprang
into new prominence. As early as 1869 Stedman had complained
that <i>The Blameless Prince</i> lay almost dead on the shelves while
such books as Murray's <i>Adventures in the Wilderness</i> sold enormously.
For a time indeed W.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;H. Murray&mdash;"Adirondack
Murray"&mdash;did vie even with Bonner's <i>Ledger</i> in popularity.
He threw about the wilderness an alluring, half romantic atmosphere
that appealed to the popular imagination and sent
forth, eager and compelling, what in later days came to be known
as "the call of the wild." His books have not lasted. There
is about them a declamatory, artificial element that sprang too
often from the intellect rather than the heart. Charles Dudley
Warner in his <i>In the Wilderness</i>, 1878, and William H. Gibson
in such books as <i>Camp Life in the Woods</i>, sympathetically illustrated
by their author, were far more sincere and wholesome.
Everywhere for a decade or more there was appeal for a return
to the natural and the free, to the open-air games of the old
English days, to hunting and trapping and camping&mdash;a masculine,
red-blooded resurgence of the savage, a return to the wild.
The earlier phase of the period may be said to have culminated
in 1882 with the founding of <i>Outing</i>, a magazine devoted wholly
to activities in the open air.</p>

<p>The later eighties and the nineties are the period of the bird
books. C.&nbsp;C. Abbott's <i>A Naturalist's Rambles About Home</i>,
1884; Olive Thorne Miller's <i>Bird Ways</i>, 1885; Bradford Torrey's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
<i>Birds in the Bush</i>, 1885; and Florence Merriam Bailey's
<i>Birds Through an Opera Glass</i>, 1889, may be taken as representative.
Bird life and bird ways for a period became a fad; enthusiastic
observers sprang up everywhere; scientific treatises
and check lists and identification guides like Chapman's <i>Handbook
of Birds of Eastern North America</i>, began to appear in
numbers. What the novelists of locality were doing for the unusual
human types in isolated corners of the land, the nature
writers were doing for the birds.</p>

<p>Of all the later mass of Nature writings, however, very little
is possessed of literary distinction. Very largely it is journalistic
in style and scientific in spirit. Only one out of the later
group, Bradford Torrey, compels attention. Beyond a doubt
it is already safe to place him next in order after Burroughs and
Muir. He is more of an artist than Burroughs, and he is more
literary and finished than Muir. In his attitude toward Nature
he is like Thoreau&mdash;sensitive, sympathetic, reverent. It was he
who edited the journals of Thoreau in their final form, and it
was he also who after that experience wrote what is undoubtedly
the most discriminating study that has yet been made of the
great mystic naturalist.</p>

<span class="subhead">WALT WHITMAN</span></h2>

<p>Whitman and Thoreau stand as the two prophets of the mid
century, both of them offspring of the Transcendental movement,
pushing its theories to their logical end, both of them
voices in the wilderness crying to deaf or angry ears, both of
them unheeded until a new generation had arisen to whom they
had become but names and books. Thoreau was born in 1817;
Whitman in 1819, the year of Lowell, Story, Parsons, Herman
Melville, J.&nbsp;G. Holland, Julia Ward Howe, and E.&nbsp;P. Whipple,
and of the Victorians, Kingsley, Ruskin, George Eliot, and Arthur
Hugh Clough. Whitman published <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, his
first significant volume, in 1855, the year of <i>Hiawatha</i>, of <i>Maud</i>,
and of Arnold's <i>Poems</i>. He issued it again in 1856 and again
in 1860&mdash;a strange nondescript book rendered all the more
strange by the fact, thoroughly advertised in the second edition,
that it had won from Emerson the words: "I find it the most
extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet
contributed.... I greet you at the beginning of a great career."
But even the compelling name of Emerson could not
sell the book; little notice, in fact, was taken of it save as a few
voices expressed horror and anger; and when in 1862 Whitman
became lost in the confusion of the war, he had made not so much
impression upon America as had Thoreau at the time of his
death that same year. Until well into the seventies Walt Whitman
seemed only a curious phenomenon in an age grown accustomed
to curious phenomena.</p>

<p>The antecedents and the early training of Whitman were far
from literary. He came from a race of Long Island farmers
who had adhered to one spot for generations. No American was
ever more completely a product of our own soil.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My tongue, every atom of my blood, formed from this soil, this air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Born here of parents born here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From parents the same, and their parents' parents the same.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">They were crude, vigorous plowmen, unbookish and elemental.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
The father was the first to break from the soil and the ancestral
environment, but he left it only to become a laborer on buildings
in the neighboring city of Brooklyn.</p>

<p>The boyhood of Whitman was passed in the city, though with
long vacations in the home of his grandparents on Long Island.
His schooling was brief and desultory. He left the schools at
twelve to become office boy for a lawyer and from that time on
he drifted aimlessly from one thing to another, serving for brief
periods as doctor's clerk, compositor in a country printing office,
school teacher in various localities, editor and proprietor of a
rural weekly, stump speaker in the campaign of 1840, editor of
various small journals, contributor of Hawthornesque stories
and sketches to papers and magazines, writer of a melodramatic
novel, and in 1846 editor of the Brooklyn <i>Daily Eagle</i>. But he
could hold to nothing long. In 1848 he was induced by a stranger
who had taken a fancy to him to go to New Orleans as editor
of the <i>Crescent</i> newspaper, but within a year he was back again
in New York, where for the next few years he maintained a half-loafing,
half-working connection with several papers and periodicals.</p>

<p>It was during this period that he made himself so thoroughly
familiar with the middle and lower strata of New York City
life. He spent hours of every day riding on Broadway vehicles
and on Fulton ferry boats and making himself boon companion
of all he met. He knew the city as Muir knew the peaks
and mountain gardens of the Sierra, and he took the same delight
in discovering a new specimen of humanity on a boat or
an omnibus that Muir might take in finding a new plant on an
Alaska glacier.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I knew all the drivers then, Broadway Jack, Dressmaker, Balky
Bill, George Storms, Old Eliphant, his brother, Young Eliphant (who
came afterward), Tippy, Pop Rice, Big Frank, Yellow Joe, Pete Callahan,
Patsey Dee, and dozens more; for there were hundreds. They
had immense qualities, largely animal&mdash;eating, drinking, women&mdash;great
personal pride, in their way&mdash;perhaps a few slouches here and
there, but I should have trusted the general run of them, in their simple

<p>Almost daily, later ('50 to '60), I cross'd on the boats, often up in

surroundings. What oceanic currents, eddies, underneath&mdash;the
great tides of humanity also, with ever-shifting movements.
Indeed, I have always had a passion for ferries; to me they afford
inimitable, streaming, never-failing, living poems. The river and bay
scenery, all about New York island, any time of a fine day&mdash;hurrying,
splashing sea-tides&mdash;the changing panorama of steamers, all sizes....

<p>The earlier Whitman is a man <i>par excellence</i> of the city as
Muir is of the mountains and Thoreau of the woods.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>A jungle of writings has sprung up about Whitman; as many
as four biographies of him have appeared in a single year, yet
aside from two or three careful studies, like those of Perry and
Carpenter, no really scholarly or unbiased work has been issued.
Before the last word can be spoken of the poet there must be an
adequate text with variorum readings and chronological arrangement.
The present definitive edition is a chaos, almost useless
for purposes of study. New and old are mixed indiscriminatingly.
The "Chants Democratic," for instance, of the earlier
editions have been dismembered and scattered from end to end
of the book. All of the older poems were in constant state of
revision from edition to edition, until now patches from every
period of the poet's life may be found on many of them. Large
sections of the earlier editions were omitted, enough indeed at
one time and another to make up a volume. The fact is important,
since the material rejected by a poet at different stages in
his evolution often tells much concerning his art.</p>

<p>There is, moreover, a strange dearth of biographical material
at critical points in Whitman's life, notably during that formative
period preceding the first issue of <i>Leaves of Grass</i>. In his
later years he talked of his own experiences and aims and ideals
with the utmost freedom; through Traubel, his Boswell, he put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
himself on record with minuteness; his poetic work is all autobiographical;
and almost all of his editions are prefaced by long
explanations and defenses, yet of the really significant periods of
his life we know little. A crude man of the people, a Broadway
rough, as he described himself, who has been writing very ordinary
poems and stories and editorials&mdash;how ordinary we can
easily judge, for very many of them have been preserved&mdash;suddenly
brings out a book of poems as unlike any earlier work
of his or any previous work of his nation or language as an issue
of the <i>Amaranth</i> or the <i>Gem</i> would be unlike the book of <i>Amos</i>.
What brought about this remarkable climax? Was it the result
of an evolution within the poet's soul, an evolution extending
over a period of years? Did it come as a sudden inspiration
or as a deliberate consummation after a study of models? We
do not know. There are no contemporary letters, no transition
poems, no testimony of any friend to whom the poet laid bare his
soul. At one period we have verses like these:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We are all docile dough-faces,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They knead us with the fist,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">We labor as they list;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For them we speak&mdash;or hold our tongues,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For them we turn and twist.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">Then suddenly without warning we have this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Solitary, singing in the West, I strike up for a new world.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>That is the problem of Walt Whitman, a problem the most
baffling and the most fascinating in the later range of American
literature.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>There can be little doubt that the primal impulse in the creation
of <i>Leaves of Grass</i> came from the intellectual and moral unrest
of the thirties and the forties. Whitman caught late, perhaps
latest of all the writers of the period, the Transcendental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
spirit that had so unsettled America and the rest of the world
as well. "What a fertility of projects for the salvation of the
world!" Emerson had cried in 1844. Who "will ever forget what
was somewhat vaguely called the 'Transcendental Movement' of
thirty years ago"? Lowell had asked in 1865. "Apparently
set astir by Carlyle's essays on the 'Signs of the Times,' and on
'History,' the final and more immediate impulse seemed to be
given by 'Sartor Resartus.' At least the republication in Boston
of that wonderful Abraham à Sancta Clara sermon on Falstaff's
text of the miserable forked radish gave the signal for
a sudden mental and moral mutiny.... The nameless eagle of
the tree Ygdrasil was about to set at last, and wild-eyed enthusiasts
rushed from all sides, eager to thrust under the mystic
bird that chalk egg from which the newer and fairer creation
was to be hatched in due <span class="locked">time."<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></span> Whitman was a product of
this ferment. He took its exaggerations and its wild dreams as
solemn fact. He read Emerson and adopted his philosophy
literally and completely: "Whoso would be a man must be a
nonconformist." "He who would gather immortal palms must
not be hindered by the name of goodness." "Insist on yourself;
never imitate." "Welcome evermore to gods and men is
the self-helping man. For him all doors are flung wide; him all
tongues greet, all honors crown, all eyes follow with desire. Our
love goes out to him." "Trust thyself; every heart vibrates to
that iron string." "With consistency a great soul has simply
nothing to do," and so on and on.</p>

<p>All criticism of Whitman must begin with the fact that he
was uneducated even to ignorance. He felt rather than
thought. Of the intellectual life in the broader sense&mdash;science,
analysis, patient investigation&mdash;he knew nothing. When he read
he read tumultuously, without horizon, using his emotions and
his half conceptions as interpreters. A parallel may be drawn
between him and that other typical product of the era, Mrs.
Eddy, the founder of the Christian Science cult. Both were
mystics, almost pathologically so; both were electric with the urge
of physical health; both were acted upon by the transcendental
spirit of the era; both were utterly without humor; and both in
all seriousness set about to establish a new conception of religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I too, following many, and followed by many, inaugurate a Religion.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>To Whitman the religious leader of an era was its poet. He
would broaden the conception of the Poet until he made of him
the leader and the savior of his age.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The maker of poems settles justice, reality, immortality,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His insight and power encircle things and the human race,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The singers are welcomed, understood, appear often enough&mdash;but rare has the day been, likewise the spot, of the birth of the maker of poems,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not every century, or every five centuries, has contained such a day, for all its names.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>With assurance really sublime he announced himself as this
poet of the new era, this new prophet of the ages:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Bearded, sunburnt, gray-necked, forbidding, I have arrived<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be wrestled with.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I know my omnivorous words, and I cannot say any less,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And would fetch you, whoever you are, flush with myself.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>He hails as comrade and fellow savior even Him who was
crucified:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We few, equals, indifferent of lands, indifferent of times,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We, inclosers of all continents, all castes&mdash;allower of all theologies,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">We walk silent among disputes and assertions, but reject not the disputers, nor anything that is asserted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We hear the bawling and din&mdash;we are reached at by divisions, jealousies, recriminations on every side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They close peremptorily upon us to surround us, my comrade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet we walk unheld, free, the whole earth over, journeying up and down, till we make our ineffaceable mark upon time and the diverse eras,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till we saturate time and eras, that the men and women of races, ages to come, may prove brethren and lovers as we are.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>He too would give his life to the lowly and the oppressed; he
too would eat with publicans and sinners; he too would raise the
sick and the dying:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span></p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<span class="i0">I have embraced you.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>The poetic message of Whitman, the new message that was, as
he believed, "to drop in the earth the germs of a greater religion,"
he summed up himself in the phrase "The greatness of
Love and Democracy"&mdash;Love meaning comradeship, hearty
"hail, fellow, well met" to all men alike; Democracy meaning
the equality of all things and all men&mdash;<i>en masse</i>. He is to be
the poet of the East and the West, the North and the South
alike; he is to be the poet of all occupations, and of all sorts and
conditions of men. He salutes the whole world <i>in toto</i> and in
detail. A great part of <i>Leaves of Grass</i> is taken up with
enumerations of the universality and the detail of his poetic sympathy.
He covers the nation with the accuracy of a gazetteer,
and he enumerates its industries and its population, simply that
he may announce, "I am the poet of these also."</p>

<p>The appearance of Whitman marks the first positive resurgence
of masculinity in mid-century America. He came as the
first loud protest against sentimentalism, against Longfellowism,
against a prudish drawing-room literature from which all life
and masculine coarseness had been refined. Whitman broke into
the American drawing-room as a hairy barbarian, uncouth and
unsqueamish, a Goth let loose among ladies, a Vandal smashing
the bric-à-brac of an over-refined generation. He came in with
a sudden leap, unlooked-for, unannounced, in all his nakedness
and vulgarity like a primitive man, and proceeded to sound his
barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world. He mixed high and
low, blab and divinity, because he knew no better. Like the
savage that he was he adorned himself with scraps of feathers
from his reading&mdash;fine words: <i>libertad</i>, <i>camerado</i>, <i>ma femme</i>,
<i>ambulanza</i>, <i>enfans d'Adam</i>; half understood fragments of modern
science; wild figures of speech from the Transcendental
dreamers which he took literally and pushed to their logical limit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
And he poured it all out in a mélange without coherence or logical
sequence: poetry and slang, bravado and egotism, trash and divinity
and dirt. At one moment he sings:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Smile, O voluptuous, cool-breathed Earth!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth of departed sunset! Earth of the mountains, misty-topt!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon, just tinged with blue!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth of shine and dark, mottling the tide of the river!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth of the limpid gray of clouds, brighter and clearer for my sake!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far-swooping elbowed Earth! Rich, apple-blossomed Earth!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smile, for Your Lover comes!<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">And the next moment be bursts out:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Earth! you seem to look for something at my hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, old Top-knot! what do you want?<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">And he does it all honestly, unsmilingly, and ignorantly. It is
because he had so small a horizon that he seems so to project beyond
the horizon. To understand him one must understand first
his ignorance.</p>

<p>But if he is a savage, he has also the vigor and dash and
abounding health of the savage. He enters upon his work with
unction and perfect abandonment; his lines shout and rush and
set the blood of his reader thrilling like a series of war whoops.
His first poem, the "Proto-Leaf," is, to say the least, exhilarating.
Read straight through aloud with resonant voice, it arouses in
the reader a strange kind of excitement. The author of it was
young, in the very tempest of perfect physical health, and he had
all of the youth's eagerness to change the course of things. His
work is as much a gospel of physical perfection as is <i>Science and
Health</i>. It is full of the impetuous passions of youth. It is not
the philosophizing of an old savant, or of an observer experienced
in life, it is the compelling arrogance of a young man in
full blood, sure of himself, eager to reform the universe. The
poems indeed are</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Health chants&mdash;joy chants&mdash;robust chants of young men.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">The physical as yet is supreme. Of the higher laws of sacrifice,
of self-effacement, of character that builds its own aristocracy and
draws lines through even the most democratic mass, the poet
knows really nothing. He may talk, but as yet it is talk without
basis of experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
The poems are youthful in still another way: they are of the
young soil of America; they are American absolutely, in spirit,
in color, in outlook. Like Thoreau, Whitman never had all his
life long any desire to visit any other land than his own. He
was obsessed, intoxicated, with America. He began his reckoning
of time with the year 1775 and dated his first book "the year
80 of the States." A large section of his poems is taken up with
loving particularization of the land&mdash;not of New England and
New York alone, but of the whole of it, every nook and corner
of it. For the first time America had a poet who was as broad
as her whole extent and who could dwell lovingly on every river
and mountain and village from Atlantic to Pacific.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Take my leaves, America!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make welcome for them everywhere, for they are your own offspring.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surround them, East and West!<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">He glories in the heroic deeds of America, the sea fight of John
Paul Jones, the defense of the Alamo, and his characterization
of the various sections of the land thrills one and exhilarates one
like a glimpse of the flag. What a spread, continent-wide, free-aired
and vast&mdash;"Far breath'd land, Arctic braced! Mexican
breezed!"&mdash;one gets in the crescendo beginning:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O the lands!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lands scorning invaders! Interlinked, food-yielding lands!<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">It is the first <i>all</i> American thrill in our literature.</p>

<p>The new literary form adopted by Whitman was not a deliberate
and studied revolt from the conventional forms of the
times: it was rather a discovery of Walt Whitman by himself.
Style is the man: the "easily written, loose-fingered chords"
of his chant, unrimed, lawless; this was Whitman himself. How
he found it or when he found it, matters not greatly. It is possible
that he got a hint from his reading of Ossian or of the Bible
or of Eastern literature, but we know that at the end it came
spontaneously. He was too indolent to elaborate for himself
a deliberate metrical system, he was too lawless of soul to be
bound by the old prosody. Whatever he wrote must loaf along
with perfect freedom, unpolished, haphazard, incoherent. The
adjective that best describes his style is <i>loose</i>&mdash;not logical, rambling,
suggestive. His mind saunters everywhither and does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
concentrate. In other words, it is an uneducated mind, an unfocused
mind, a primitive mind.</p>

<p>The result was that, despite Whitman's freshness and force
and stirring Americanism, he made little impression in the decade
following the first <i>Leaves of Grass</i>. Emerson's commendation
of him had been caused by his originality and his uncouth power,
but none of the others of the mid-century school could see anything
in the poems save vulgarity and egotistic posing. Lowell
from first to last viewed him with aversion; Whittier burned the
book at once as a nasty thing that had soiled him. The school
of Keats and Tennyson, of Longfellow and Willis, ruled American
literature with tyrannic power, and it was too early for
successful revolution.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>The Civil War found Whitman young; it left him an old
man. There seems to have been no middle-age period in his
life. He had matured with slowness; at forty, when he issued
the 1860 <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, he was in the very prime of youth,
the physical still central. There had been no suffering in his
life, no grip of experience; he spoke much of the soul, but the
soul was still of secondary importance. He wrote to his mother
in 1862:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I believe I weigh about two hundred, and as to my face (so scarlet)
and my beard and neck, they are terrible to behold. I fancy the reason
I am able to do some good in the hospitals among the poor languishing
and wounded boys, is that I am so large and well&mdash;indeed like a great
wild buffalo, with much hair. Many of the soldiers are from the West,
and far North, and they take to a man that has not the bleached, shiny
and shaven cut of the cities and the <span class="locked">East.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The world of the 1860 <i>Leaves of Grass</i> is a world as viewed by a
perfectly healthy young man, who has had his way to the full.
The appeal of it is physiological rather than spiritual. It ends
the first period of Whitman's poetical life.</p>

<p>His next book, <i>Drum-Taps</i>, came in 1866. Between the two
had come the hospital experience of 1862&ndash;1865, from which had
emerged the Whitman of the later period.</p>

<p>He had been drawn into this hospital experience, as into everything
else in his life, almost by accident. It had come to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
after no hard-fought battle with himself; it was the result of
no compelling convictions. The war had progressed for a year
before it assumed concrete proportions for him. It required the
news that his brother was lying desperately wounded at Fredericksburg
to move his imagination. When he had arrived at
the front and had found his brother in no serious condition after
all, he had drifted almost by accident into the misery of the
ambulance trains and the hospitals, and before he had realized
it, he was in the midst of the army nurses, working as if he had
volunteered for the service. And thus he had drifted on to the
end of the war, a self-appointed hospital worker, touching and
helping thousands of sinking lives.</p>

<p>And he gave during those three years not only his youth but
also his health of body. He was weakened at length with malaria
and infected with blood poisoning from a wound that he had
dressed. Moreover, the experience drained him on the side of his
emotions and his nervous vitality until he went home to become
at last paralytic and neurotic. The strain upon him he has described
with a realism that unnerves one:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I dress the perforated shoulder, the foot with the bullet-wound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cleanse the one with a gnawing and putrid gangrene, so sickening, so offensive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the attendant stands beside me holding the tray and pail.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am faithful, I do not give out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fractur'd thigh, the knee, the wound in the abdomen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These and more I dress with impassive hand (yet deep in my breast a fire, a burning flame).<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>The war allowed Whitman to put into practice all his young
manhood's dream of saviorship. It turned him from a preacher
into a prophet and a man of action, one who took his earlier message
and illustrated it at every point with works. It awakened
within him a new ideal of life. He had been dealing heretofore
with words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Words! book-words! What are you?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Words no more, for harken and see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My song is there in the open air, and I must sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the banner and pennant a-flapping.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>No longer does he exult in his mere physical body. Lines like
these he now edits from his early editions:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span></p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How dare a sick man, or an obedient man, write poems for these States?<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">Also lines like these:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O to be relieved of distinctions! to make as much of vices as virtues!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O to level occupations and the sexes! O to bring all to common ground! O adhesiveness!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O the pensive aching to be together,&mdash;you know not why, and I know not why.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">He omits everywhere freely now from the early editions, not
from the "Children of Adam," however, though Emerson advised
it with earnestness. The Whitmans were an obstinate race.
"As obstinate as a Whitman," had been a degree of comparison;
and here was one of them who had taken a position before
the world and had maintained it in the face of persecution. Retreat
would be impossible; but it is noteworthy that he wrote no
more poems of sex and that he put forth no more of his tall talk
and braggadocio. Swiftly he had become the poet of the larger
life: the immaterial in man, the soul.</p>

<p><i>Drum-Taps</i>, 1866, gives us the first glimpse of this new Whitman.
The tremendous poem, "Rise, O Days, from Your Fathomless
Deeps," marks the transition. In it he declares that he had,
with hunger of soul, devoured only what earth had given him,
that he had sought to content himself simply with nature and the
material world.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet there with my soul I fed, I fed content, supercilious.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">He does not condemn this earlier phase of his development:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Twas well, O soul&mdash;'twas a good preparation you gave me,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now we go forth to receive what the earth and the sea never gave us.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">Now for the first time he realizes the meaning of Democracy, the
deep inner meaning of Man and America.</p>

<span class="i0">Hungering, hungering, hungering, for primal energies and Nature's dauntlessness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I refresh'd myself with it only, I could relish it only,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I waited the bursting forth of the pent fire&mdash;on the water and air I waited long;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now I no longer wait, I am fully satisfied, I am glutted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have witness'd the true lightning, I have witness'd my cities electric,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have lived to behold man burst forth.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">It is the same thrill that had aroused Stedman, and made him
proud for the first time of his country. Henceforth the poet will
sing of Men&mdash;men not as magnificent bodies, but as triumphant
souls. <i>Drum-Taps</i> fairly quivers and sobs and shouts with a new
life. America has risen at last&mdash;one feels it in every line. The
book gives more of the actual soul of the great conflict and of the
new spirit that arose from it than any other book ever written.
"Come up from the Fields, Father," tells with simple pathos
that chief tragedy of the war, the death message brought to
parents; "The Wound-Dresser" pictures with a realism almost
terrifying the horrors of the hospitals after a battle; "Beat!
Beat! Drums!" arouses like a bugle call; such sketches as "Cavalry
Crossing a Ford," "Bivouac on a Mountain Side," and "A
March in the Ranks Hard-Prest, and the Road Unknown," are
full of the thrill and the excitement of war; and finally the poems
in "Memories of President Lincoln": among them "When
Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd," "O Captain! My Captain!"
and "Hush'd Be the Camps To-day," come near to the
highest places yet won by elegaic verse in English.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>In June, 1865, after he had served for a short time as a clerk
in the Interior Department at Washington, Whitman had been
discharged on the ground that he kept in his desk an indecent
book of which he was the author. As a result of the episode, W.
D. O'Connor, an impetuous young journalist, published in September
the same year a pamphlet entitled <i>The Good Gray Poet</i>,
defending Whitman as a man incapable of grossness and hailing
him as a new force in American literature. Despite its extravagance
and its manifest special pleading, the little book is a notable
one, a document indeed in the history of the new literary period.
It recognized that a new era was opening, one that was to be
original and intensely American.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It [<i>Leaves of Grass</i>] is, in the first place, a work purely and entirely
American, autochthonic, sprung from our own soil; no savor of Europe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
nor of the past, nor of any other literature in it; a vast carol of our
own land, and of its Present and Future; the strong and haughty psalm
of the Republic. There is not one other book, I care not whose, of
which this can be said. I weigh my words and have considered well.
Every other book by an American author implies, both in form and
substance, I cannot even say the European, but the British mind. The
shadow of Temple Bar and Arthur's Seat lies dark on all our letters.
Intellectually, we are still a dependency of Great Britain, and one word&mdash;colonial&mdash;comprehends
and stamps our literature.... At most, our
best books were but struggling beams; behold in <i>Leaves of Grass</i> the
immense and absolute sunrise! It is all our own! The nation is in it!
In form a series of chants, in substance it is an epic of America. It is
distinctly and utterly American. Without model, without imitation,
without reminiscence, it is evolved entirely from our own polity and
popular life.</p></blockquote>

<p>The defense fell for the most part on deaf ears. It had been
Whitman's dream that the great poet of democracy was to be
the idol of the common people, the poet loved and read even by
the illiterate.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The woodman that takes his ax and jug with him shall take me with him all day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The farm-boy, plowing in the field, feels good at the sound of my voice.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">But the common people heard him not gladly: they preferred
Longfellow. The American average man&mdash;"en masse"&mdash;sees no
poetry in him. Moreover, he has been rejected very largely by
the more educated. It has been his curious experience to be
repudiated by democratic America and to be accepted and hailed
as a prophet by the aristocratic intellectual classes of England
and of Europe generally. Swinburne, W.&nbsp;M. Rossetti, Symonds,
Dowden, Saintsbury, Tennyson, and very many others accepted
him early and at full value, as did also Freiligrath, Schmidt,
and Björnson. A cult early sprang up about him, one composed
largely of mystics, and revolutionists, and reformers in all fields.</p>

<p>In 1871, Whitman issued what unquestionably is his most
notable prose work, <i>Democratic Vistas</i>. It is pitched in major
key: it swells O'Connor's piping note into a trumpet blast.
Boldly and radically it called for a new school of literature.
The old is outgrown, it cried; the new is upon us; make ready
for the great tide of Democratic poetry and prose that even now
is sweeping away the old landmarks.</p>

<p>To the new era it was what Emerson's <i>American Scholar</i> was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
to the period that had opened in the thirties. It was our last
great declaration of literary independence. Emerson, the Harvard
scholar, last of a long line of intellectual clergymen, had
pleaded for the aristocracy of literature, the American scholar,
the man thinking his own thoughts, alone, the set-apart man of
his generation; Whitman pleaded for the democracy of literature,
for an American literature that was the product of the
mass, a literature of the people, for the people, and by the people.
Emerson had spoken as an oracle: "What crowded and breathless
aisles! What windows clustering with eager heads!" Whitman
was as one crying in the wilderness, uncouth, unheeded
save by the few. Emerson was the clarion voice of Harvard;
Whitman was the voice of the great movement that so soon was
to take away the scepter from Harvard and transfer it upon the
strong new learning of the West. His message was clear and it
came with Carlyle-like directness:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Literature, strictly considered, has never recognized the People, and,
whatever may be said, does not to-day.</p>

<p>Our fundamental want to-day in the United States, with closest,
amplest reference to present conditions, and to the future, is of a class,
and the clear idea of a class, of native authors, literati, far different,
far higher in grade than any yet known, sacerdotal, modern, fit to cope
with our occasions, lands, permeating the whole mass of American
mentality, taste, belief, breathing into it a new breath of life.</p></blockquote>

<p>He has this to say of the poets who thus far had voiced
America:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Touch'd by the national test, or tried by the standards of democratic
personality, they wither to ashes. I say I have not seen a single writer,
artist, lecturer, or what-not, that has confronted the voiceless but ever
erect and active, pervading, underlying will and typic aspiration of the
land, in a spirit kindred to itself. Do you call these genteel little creatures
American poets? Do you term that perpetual, pistareen, paste-pot
work, American art, American drama, taste, verse? I think I hear,
echoed as from some mountaintop afar in the west, the scornful laugh
of the Genius of these States.</p></blockquote>

<p>America has not been free. She has echoed books; she has
looked too earnestly to the East.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>America has yet morally and artistically originated nothing. She
seems singularly unaware that the models of persons, books, manners,
&amp;c., appropriate for former conditions and for European lands, are
but exiles and exotics here.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
Our literature must be American in spirit and in background,
and only American.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What is the reason our time, our lands, that we see no fresh local
courage, sanity, of our own&mdash;the Mississippi, stalwart Western men,
real mental and physical facts, Southerners, &amp;c., in the body of our
literature? especially the poetic part of it. But always instead, a
parcel of dandies and ennuyés, dapper little gentlemen from abroad,
who flood us with their thin sentiment of parlors, parasols, piano-songs,
tinkling rimes, the five-hundredth importation&mdash;or whimpering and
crying about something, chasing one aborted conceit after another, and
forever occupied in dyspeptic amours with dyspeptic women. While,
current and novel, the grandest events and revolutions, and stormiest
passions of history, are crossing to-day with unparallel'd rapidity and
magnificence over the stages of our own and all the continents, offering
new materials, opening new vistas, with largest needs, inviting the
daring launching forth of conceptions in literature, inspired by them,
soaring in highest regions, serving art in its highest.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>America demands a poetry that is bold, modern, and all-surrounding
and kosmical, as she is herself. It must in no respect ignore science or
the modern, but inspire itself with science and the modern. It must
bend its vision toward the future, more than the past. Like America,
it must extricate itself from even the greatest models of the past, and,
while courteous to them, must have entire faith in itself, and the products
of its own democratic spirit only.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Faith, very old, now scared away by science, must be restored, brought
back by the same power that caused her departure&mdash;restored with new
sway, deeper, wider, higher than ever. Surely, this universal ennui,
this coward fear, this shuddering at death, these low, degrading views,
are not always to rule the spirit pervading future society, as it has in
the past, and does the present.</p></blockquote>

<p>The book came winged with a double message: it was a defense
and an explanation of Walt Whitman, the poet of democracy,
and it was the call for a new era in American literature.
In both aspects it was notable, notable as Wordsworth's early
prefaces were notable. It was both an effect and a cause. The
same impulse that launched it launched also Thoreau and the
nature school, Bret Harte and the Pike County balladists, Mark
Twain and the vulgarians, Howells and realism, and all the
great wave of literature of locality. Its effect and the effect of
<i>Leaves of Grass</i> that went with it has been a marked one. After
these two books there could be no more dilettanteism in art, no
more art for mere art's sake, no more imitation and subservience
to foreign masters; the time had come for a literature that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
genuine and compelling, one that was American both in message
and in spirit.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>1871 was the culminating year of Whitman's literary life.
He was at the fullness of his powers. His final attack of paralysis
was as yet a year away. For the exhibition of the American
Institute he put the message of <i>Democratic Vistas</i> into poetic
form&mdash;"After All, not to Create Only"&mdash;a glorious invitation
to the muses to migrate to America:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Placard "Remov'd" and "To Let" on the rocks of your snowy Parnassus,<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">a perfect hexameter line it will be noted, as also this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ended, deceas'd through time, her voice by Castaly's fountain.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">And the same year he put forth an enlarged and enriched <i>Leaves
of Grass</i>, including in it the splendid "Passage to India," celebrating
the opening of the Suez Canal, a poem that is larger
than the mere geographic bounds of its subject, world-wide as
they were, for it is a poem universe-wide, celebrating the triumphs
of the human soul.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We too take ship, O soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joyous we too launch out on trackless seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fearless for unknown shores on waves of ecstasy to sail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the wafting winds (thou pressing me to thee, I thee to me, O soul),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caroling free, singing our song of God.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Passage to more than India!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are thy wings plumed indeed for such far flights?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O soul, voyagest thou indeed on voyages like those?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disportest thou on waters such as those?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soundest below the Sanscrit and the Vedas?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then have thy bent unleash'd.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">The poems grouped around this splendid outburst, as indeed
all the rest of his poems until illness and age began to dim his
powers, are pitched in this major key. No poet in any time ever
maintained himself longer at such high levels. His poems which
he entitled "Whispers of Heavenly Death," are all of the upper
air and the glory of the released soul of man. Not even Shelley
has more of lyric abandon and pure joy than Whitman in such
songs as "Darest Thou Now, O Soul":</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then we burst forth, we float,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Time and Space, O soul, prepared for them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Equal, equipt at last (O joy! O fruit of all!) them to fulfil, O soul.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">And what deeps and abysses in a lyric like this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A noiseless patient spider,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I mark'd where on a little promontory it stood isolated,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mark'd how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It launch'd forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And you, O my soul, where you stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ceaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the bridge you will need be form'd, till the ductile anchor hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul!<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">And then at last, paralyzed and helpless, his work done, the body
he had gloried in slipping away from him, there came that magnificent
outburst of faith and optimism that throws a glory over
the whole of American poetry, the "Prayer of Columbus":</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My terminus near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clouds already closing in upon me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The voyage balk'd, the course disputed, lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I yield my ships to Thee.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My hands, my limbs grow nerveless,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My brain feels rack'd, bewildered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let the old timbers part, I will not part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will cling fast to Thee, O God, though the waves buffet me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thee, Thee at least I know.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>Sometime the poems of Whitman will be arranged in the order
in which he wrote them, and then it will be seen that the poems
by which he is chiefly judged&mdash;the chants of the body, the long
catalogues of things (reduced greatly by the poet in his later
editings), the barbaric yawp and the egotism&mdash;belong to only
one brief period in his literary development; that in his later
work he was the poet of the larger life of man, the most positive
singer of the human soul in the whole range of English literature.
If the earlier Whitman is the singer of a type of democracy
that does not exist in America except as an abstract theory,
the later Whitman is the singer of the universal heart of man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
The Whitman that will endure emerged from the furnace of the
Civil War. In his own words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Without those three or four years and the experiences they gave,
<i>Leaves of Grass</i> would not now be <span class="locked">existing.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">And again,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I know very well that my "Leaves" could not possibly have emerged
or been fashion'd or completed, from any other era than the latter half
of the nineteenth century, nor any other land than democratic America,
and from the absolute triumph of the national Union <span class="locked">arms.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>He is not always easy reading; he is not always consecutive
and logical. He said himself that the key to his style was suggestiveness.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I round and finish little, if anything; and could not, consistently
with my scheme. The reader will always have his or her part to do,
just as much as I have had mine. I seek less to state or display any
theme or thought, and more to bring you, reader, into the atmosphere
of the theme or thought&mdash;there to pursue your own flight.</p></blockquote>

<p>He is oracular; he talks darkly, like the priestess in the temple,
in snatches and Orphic ejaculations, and we listen with eagerness.
Had he been as clear and as consecutive as Longfellow he would
not have had at all the vogue that has been his. Somehow he gives
the impression constantly to his reader, as he gave it in earlier
years to Thoreau, that there is something superhuman about him.
He is a misty landscape illuminated by lightning flashes. We
feel that we are near lofty mountains; now and then we catch
glimpses of a snowy peak, but only for a moment. The fitful roll
of the thunder excites us and the flashes sometimes terrify, and
the whole effect of the experience is on the side of the feelings.
There is little clear vision. Or, perhaps, a better figure: taking
his entire work we have the great refuse heap of the universe.
He shows it to us with eagerness; nothing disgusts him, nothing
disconcerts him. Now he pulls forth a diamond, now a potsherd,
and he insists that both are equally valuable. He is joyous at
every return of the grappling hook. Are not all together in the
heap; shall the diamond say to the potsherd, I am better than
thou?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
He was early touched by the nature movement of the mid century.
With half a dozen poems he has made himself the leading
American poet of the sea. In all of his earlier work there
breathes the spirit of the living out-of-doors until he may be
ranked with Thoreau and Muir and Burroughs. It was the
opinion of Burroughs that "No American poet has studied American
nature more closely than Whitman, or is more cautious in
his uses of it." He is not the poet of the drawing-room&mdash;he is
the poet of the vast sweep of the square miles, of the open sky, of
the cosmos. "Democracy most of all affiliates with the open air,"
he contended; "is sunny and hardy and sane only with Nature&mdash;just
as much as art is." And it was his mission, as he conceived
it, "to bring people back from their persistent strayings and
sickly abstractions, to the costless average, divine, original concrete."</p>

<p>He is not a scientist with Nature; he does not know enough to
be a scientist, and his methods and cast of mind are hopelessly
unscientific. He is simply a man who feels.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You must not know too much, or be too precise or scientific about
birds and trees and flowers and water craft; a certain free margin, and
even vagueness&mdash;perhaps ignorance, credulity&mdash;helps your enjoyment
of these things, and of the sentiment of feather'd, wooded, river, or
marine nature generally. I repeat it&mdash;don't want to know too exactly,
or the reasons why.</p></blockquote>

<p>Such a paragraph is worth a chapter of analysis, and so also
is a poem like this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When I heard the learn'd astronomer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till rising and gliding out I wander'd off by myself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the mystical moist night air, and from time to time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">His intellect is not so developed as his emotions. He cannot
think; he can feel. And after all is not the essence of all poetry,
of all the meanings of life, of the soul, of Nature in its message
to man, a thing not of the intellect but of the sensitive spirit of
man?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span></p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Of Whitman's poetic form there is still much to learn. In its
earlier phases there was a sprawliness about it that at times was
almost fatal to poetic effects, but he grew more metric with every
edition and more and more pruned out the worst of his lines, such
for instance as this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Or, another time, in warm weather, out in a boat, to lift the lobster-pots, where they are sunk with heavy stones (I know the buoys).<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">His lines are not prose, even the worst of them. There is a roll
about them, a falling of the voice at stressed intervals, an alternate
time-beat, crude at times, violated often, yet nevertheless an
obedience to law.</p>

<p>It is impossible for any poet, however lawless and apathetic
to rules, to compose year after year without at last falling into a
stereotyped habit of manner, and evolving a metric roll that is
second nature. That Whitman was not conscious of any metric
law within himself goes without saying. He believed that he was
as free as the tides of the ocean and the waves that rolled among
the rocks&mdash;lawless, unconfined.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have not only not bother'd much about style, form, art, etc., but I
confess to more or less apathy (I believe I have sometimes caught myself
in decided aversion) toward them throughout, asking nothing of
them but negative advantages&mdash;that they should never impede me, and
never under any circumstances, or for their own purposes only, assume
any mastery over <span class="locked">me.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>But a study of Whitman reveals the fact that certain laws <i>did</i>
more and more assume mastery over him. With every year the
time-beat of his poems grew increasingly hexametric. One may
go through his later poems and find on the average a full hexameter
line on every page. I quote at random:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To the cities and farms I sing as they spread in the sunshine before me.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How shall the young man know the whether and when of his brother?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Behold thy fields and farms, thy far-off woods and mountains.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">His ear unconsciously seemed to demand the roll of the dactyl,
then a cesura after from five to seven beats, then a closing roll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
longer or shorter as his mood struck him. The greater number
of his later lines open as if the line was to be a hexameter: "Over
the breast of the spring," "Passing the yellow-spear'd wheat,"
"Passing the apple tree blows," "Coffin that passes through
lakes," and so on and on.</p>

<p>But one can make a broader statement. The total effect of the
poems after 1870, like the "Song of the Redwood," for instance,
is hexametric, though few of the lines may be hexameters as they
stand. One might arrange this song like this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A California song, | a prophecy and indirection,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thought impalpable | to breathe as air, a chorus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of dryads, fading departing, | or hamadryads departing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A murmuring, fateful giant | voice out of the earth and sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Voice of a mighty dying | tree in the redwood forest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dense. Farewell my brethren, | Farewell O earth and sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Farewell ye neighboring waters, | my time has ended, my term<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has come along the northern coast | just back from the rockbound shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the caves in the saline air | from the sea in the Mendocino<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Country with the surge for base | and accompaniment low and hoarse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With crackling blows of axes | sounding musically driven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By strong arms driven deep | by the sharp tongues of the axes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There in the redwood forest | dense I heard the mighty<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tree in its death chant chanting.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">Crude hexameters these undoubtedly, requiring much wrenching
and eliding at times, yet for all that as one reads them aloud one
cannot escape the impression that the total effect is hexametric.
May it not be that the primal time beat for poetry is the hexameter,
and that the prehistoric poets evolved it spontaneously
even as the creator of <i>Leaves of Grass</i> evolved it?</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>To insist that Whitman has had small influence on later poetry
because none of the later poets has made use of his chant is feeble
criticism. No poet even <i>can</i> make use of his verse form without
plagiarism, for his loose-fingered chords and his peculiar time-beat,
his line-lengths, his wrenched hexameters&mdash;all this was
Whitman himself. In all other ways he enormously influenced
his age. His realism, his concrete pictures, his swing and freedom,
his Americanism, his insistence upon message, ethic purpose,
absolute fidelity to the here and now rather than to books
of the past&mdash;all have been enormously influential. He is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
central figure of the later period, the voice in the wilderness that
hailed its dim morning and the strong singer of its high noon.</p>

<h3>BIBLIOGRAPHY</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Walt Whitman.</span> (1819&ndash;1892.) During the lifetime of the poet there
were issued ten editions of <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, with the following dates:

<span class="subhead">THE CLASSICAL REACTION</span></h2>

<p>The nineteenth century both in Europe and America was a
period of revolt, of breakings away from tradition, of voices in
the wilderness. It was the age of Byron and Shelley, of Carlyle
and Tolstoy, of Heine and Hugo. Literature came everywhere
as the voice of revolution. It rang with protest&mdash;Dickens and
George Eliot, Kingsley, Whittier, and Mrs. Stowe; it dreamed
of a new social era&mdash;Fourier and the sons of Rousseau in France,
the Transcendentalists in America; it let itself go in romantic
abandon and brought back in a flood feeling and sentiment&mdash;the
<i>spätromantiker</i> and Bulwer-Lytton and Longfellow. Everywhere
conviction, intensity, travail of soul.</p>

<p>The school died in the last quarter of the century consumed of
its own impetuous spirit, and it left no heirs. A feminine age
had come, an age of convention and of retrospect. The romantic
gave way to the inevitable classic; the hot passion of revolt to the
cool fit of deliberate art. In America, the New England school
that had ruled the mid years of the century became reminiscent,
fastidious, self-contained, to awake in sudden realization that it
no longer was a power, that its own second generation were women
led by Aldrich, James, Howells, immigrants from New York
and the West. The early leaders, Emerson, Whittier, Lowell, all
intensity and conviction, had been replaced by the school of deliberate
workmen who had no message for their times, only technique
and brilliancy.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>This reaction from the New England school can be studied nowhere
more convincingly than in the personalities and work of
Henry James, father and son. The elder James, companion of
Carlyle and Emerson and Alcott, disciple and interpreter of
Swedenborg and Sandeman, was a typical product of the mid-century
school&mdash;mystical, intense, concerned with the inner rather
than the other aspects of man. "Henry James was true comfort,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
Emerson wrote in his diary in 1850; "wise, gentle, polished,
with heroic manners and a serenity like the sun." He pursued
no profession, but like Alcott devoted his life to philosophy
and to literature. He wrote for the few a small handful of books,
mostly forgotten now, though he who would read them will find
them clothed in a richness of style and a felicity of expression
that reminds one of the prose of the greater periods of English
<span class="locked">literature.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>The son of this mid-century genius, Henry James, Jr., cultured,
cold, scientific, disciple of Turgenieff, of Flaubert and Daudet,
Maupassant and Zola&mdash;"grandsons of Balzac"&mdash;stands as the
type of the "later manner," the new school that wrote without
message, that studied with intensity the older models, that talked
evermore of its "art."</p>

<p>"We know very little about a talent," this younger James has
written in his essay on Stevenson, "till we know where it grew
up." The James family, we know, grew up outside the New
England environment, in the State of New York&mdash;first at Albany,
where the future novelist was born in 1843, then until he was
twelve in New York City. But this in reality tells us nothing.
The boy grew up in London rather than New York. The father
had inherited means that permitted a retired and scholarly life.
Following the birth of Henry, his second son, he had taken his
family for a year and a half to England, and he had come back,
both he and his wife, to quote his son's words, "completely Europeanized."
"Had <i>all</i> their talk for its subject, in my infant
ears, that happy time?&mdash;did it deal only with London and Piccadilly
and the Green Park?... I saw my parents homesick, as
I conceived, for the ancient <span class="locked">order."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></span> He grew up in the presence
of imported books and papers, the smell of whose ink fresh from
London and the Strand fed his imagination.</p>

<p>Even his playmates transported him into the old world. It
was one Louis De Coppet, a small boy, "straight from the Lake
of Geneva," that first really aroused in him "the sense of Europe
... that pointed prefigurement of the manners of 'Europe,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
which, inserted wedge-like, if not to say peg-like, into my young
allegiance was to split the tender organ into such unequal halves.
His the toy hammer that drove in the very point of the golden
nail. It was as if there had been a mild magic in that breath,
however scant, of another <span class="locked">world."<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></span> While other lads were reading
their juveniles, the young James was poring over <i>Punch</i>.
"From about 1850 to 1855," he writes in his essay on Du
Maurier, speaking of himself in the third person, "he lived, in
imagination, no small part of the time, in the world represented
by the pencil of Leech.... These things were the features of a
world which he longed so to behold that the familiar woodcuts
grew at last as real to him as the furniture of his home."</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Such was the early environment of Henry James. Refinement
and rare culture breathed upon his cradle and surrounded his
whole boyhood like an atmosphere. He was kept sheltered from
the world without, as from something coarse and degrading. He
was not allowed to attend the public schools. "Considering with
much pity our four stout boys," the father wrote to Emerson in
1849, "who have no playroom within doors and import shocking
bad manners from the street, we gravely ponder whether it
wouldn't be better to go abroad for a few years with them, allowing
them to absorb French and German and get such a sensuous
education as they cannot get <span class="locked">here."<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>The plan did not mature until 1855 when the boy was twelve.
In the <i>interim</i> tutors were employed for his education who instructed
him with desultory, changing methods, allowing him
always to take apparently the paths of his preference. In these
same paths he seems to have continued during the four years of
his residence abroad with his parents in London, Geneva, Boulogne-sur-Mer,
and Paris. All harshness he avoided, all sharpness
of discipline&mdash;mathematics, examinations. He would sit,
boy as he was, only in the places of beauty and refinement. "The
whole perfect Parisianism I seemed to myself always to have possessed
mentally&mdash;even if I had but just turned <span class="locked">twelve."<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>One does not understand Henry James who neglects this formative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
period of his life. He returned to America an esthete, a
dreamer, with his heart in the lands of culture, dissatisfied with
the rush and rudeness that were preparing a new world for its
future. He was too frail in health to enter the armies which
soon were recruiting about him for the great war; he had no inclination,
because of his father's prejudice, to undertake a college
course; he shrank from the usual professions open to young
men of his class. He did for a year attend lectures at the Harvard
Law School, but it was with no thought of preparing for a
legal career. He dreamed of literature as a profession. He
would woo the muse, but the muse he would woo "was of course
the muse of prose fiction&mdash;never for the briefest hour in my case
the presumable, not to say the presuming, the much-taking-for-granted
muse of rime, with whom I had never had, even in
thought, the faintest flirtation." For this profession he trained
himself as deliberately and as laboriously as if it were the violin
that he was to master, or the great organ. He read industriously,
especially in the French; he resided now in Boston, where his
father at last had settled, now in France, now in Italy. Like
Story, the sculptor, whom in so many ways he resembled, he
would live at the richest centers of his art. Finally, in the late
seventies, he took up his residence permanently abroad to return
only as a rare visitant.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Henry James more than any other American author stands for
specialization, for a limited field cultivated intensively and exclusively.
Poetry, as he has explained, was no part of his endowment;
he never attempted it even at the age when all men
are poets; romance never attracted him. He approached his
chosen field of prose fiction deliberately as a scientist, and prepared
himself for it as a man studies medicine. He began as he
ended&mdash;more crude in his art to be sure, more conventional, more
youthful in thought and diction, yet not fundamentally different
from his final manner.</p>

<p>His first published work, <i>The Story of a Year</i>, which appeared
in the March, 1865, number of the <i>Atlantic</i>, at first reading seems
little different from the hundreds of tales of the Civil War that
were appearing everywhere during the period. It is full of a
young man's smartness and literary affectations: "In early May,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
two years ago, a young couple I wot of," etc. "Good reader, this
narrative is averse to retrospect," etc. And yet the story, despite
its youthfulness, contains all the elements that we now associate
with the fiction of Henry James. It is first of all a slight
story&mdash;not so slight as some of the later work, but nevertheless a
mere episode expanded into a novelette; furthermore, it was written
not so much for the displaying of movement of incident as
for the analysis of movements of feeling and the growth of elements
of character: "I have to chronicle," he says at one point,
"another silent transition." Then too its ending suggests the
French school:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"No, no, no," she almost shrieked, turning about in the path. "I
forbid you to follow me."</p>

<p>But for all that he went in.</p></blockquote>

<p>We stand uncertain, startled, piqued&mdash;then the suggestion
comes surging over us: Perhaps the author means that she married
him after all! Could she do it? Did she do it? And then
we find with a thrill of surprise that he has given us the full
answer in his previous analysis of her character. It is finesse, it
is the careful adjustment of parts, it is deliberate art.</p>

<p>There are other characteristics in the story that were to mark
all the work of James. The tale, for instance, leaves us unmoved.
We admire its brilliancy, but at no point does it grip us with its
tragedy or its comedy. The faithlessness of the heroine and the
death of the hero alike leave us cold. We do not care. Sympathy,
the sympathy of comprehension, that sympathy that enters
into the little world the author has created and for a time
loses itself as if it were actually native there&mdash;of this there is
nothing. It is all objective, external phenomena observed and
recorded on a pad&mdash;a thing alone of the intellect.</p>

<p>That James should have followed this story with an essay on
"The Novels of George Eliot" is no mere coincidence. How completely
he had saturated himself with all the work of the great
English sibyl, appears on every page. Her faithfulness to her
material, her vivid photographs, her devotion to science which
little by little crushed out her woman's heart, her conception of
the novel as the record of a dissection&mdash;the reactions of human
souls under the scalpel and the microscope, her materialism that
refused all testimony save that of the test-tube and the known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
reagents, that reduced man to a problem in psychology&mdash;all this
made its reflex upon the young student. He too became a scientist,
taking nothing for granted, stripping himself of all illusions,
relegating the ideal, the intuitive, the spiritual to the realm of the
outgrown; he too became a taker of notes&mdash;"The new school of
fiction in France is based very much on the taking of notes," he
remarks in his essay on Daudet. "The library of the great
Flaubert, of the brothers Goncourt, of Emile Zola, and of the
writer of whom I speak, must have been in a large measure a
library of memorandum-books."<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> In his earlier work at least,
he was George Eliot with the skill and finesse of Maupassant,
and he may be summed up with his whole school in the words he
has put into the mouth of his own Anastasia Blumenthal: "It
was meager," he makes her say of the singing of Adelina Patti,
"it was trivial, it lacked soul. You can't be a great artist without
a great passion."</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>During the first period of his literary life, the period that ended
somewhere in the early nineties, James took as the subject of his
study that vagrom area that lies on the borderland between the
old culture of Europe and the new rawness of America. Howells
has made much of the longings of certain classes in the older
parts of his native land to visit the European cities, and he has
pictured more than once their idealizations of foreign things,
their retrospections and dreamings. James showed these Americans
actually in Europe, their manners as seen against the older
background, their crudeness and strength; and in doing so he
produced what was widely hailed as the new international novel.
There was nothing really new about it. James wrote of Americans
in Europe just as Mark Twain wrote of Americans on the
Mississippi or in California. As a scientist he must deal only
with facts which had passed under his own observation&mdash;that was
his much-discussed "realism"&mdash;and the life that he was most
familiar with was the life of the pensions and grand hotels of
Rome and Switzerland and Paris and London.</p>

<p>His world in reality was small. He had been reared in a
cloister-like atmosphere where he had dreamed of "life" rather
than lived it. It is almost pathetic to think of him going up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
to the Harvard Law School because in a vague way it stood for
something which he had missed and longed to feel. "I thought
of it under the head of 'life,'" he says. He had played in his
childhood with books rather than boys; he had been kept away
from his natural playmates because of their "shocking bad manners";
he had never mingled with men in a business or a professional
way; he had never married; he stood aloof from life and
observed it without being a part of it. Americans he knew chiefly
from the specimens he had found in Europe during his long residences;
European society he knew as a visitor from without.
With nothing was he in sympathy in the full meaning of the
word, that sympathy which includes its own self in the group
under observation.</p>

<p>For ten years he wrote studies, essays on his masters, George
Eliot, Balzac, Daudet, and stories that were not greatly different
from these essays&mdash;analyses of types, and social conditions, and
of the reactions that follow when a unit of one social system is
thrust into another. In 1875 he enlarged his area with <i>Roderick
Hudson</i>, a novel of length, and he followed it with <i>The American</i>,
<i>The Europeans</i>, <i>Daisy Miller</i>, and others, all of them international
in setting. In his later period, the period, say, after 1890, he
confined himself to the depicting of society in London, the rapid
change toward unconventionality in manners that marked the end
of the century. He was so far now from contact with his native
land that of necessity he must cease to use it as his source of
literary material.</p>

<p>The earlier group of stories center about a comparatively few
types. First, there are the young men of the Roland Mallet,
Ralph Touchett order, "highly civilized young Americans," he
calls them in <i>Confidence</i>, "born to an easy fortune and a tranquil
destiny"; "men who conceive of life as a fine art." His novels
are full of them, creatures of whim who know nothing of the
bitterness of struggle, who drift from capital to capital of Europe
mindful only of their own comfort, highly sensitive organisms
withal, subject to evanescent emotions which they analyze with
minuteness, and brilliant at every point when their intellectual
powers are called into play. They talk in witty flashes for hours
on end and deliver finished lectures at the call of an epigram.
They cannot talk without philosophizing or hear a maiden laugh
without analysis. They are brilliant all the time. The conversation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
of Gilbert Osmond and Mrs. Merle fills Isabel with amazement:
"They talked extremely well; it struck her almost as a
dramatic entertainment, rehearsed in advance." Page after page
they talk in a staccato, breathless profusion of wit, epigram,
repartee, verbal jewels worthy of Alexander Pope flying at every
opening of the lips&mdash;is even French culture as brilliant as this?
Mr. Brand in <i>The Europeans</i> listening to the Baroness Münster,
bursts out rapturously at last, "Now I suppose that is what is
called conversation, real conversation. It is quite the style we
have heard about&mdash;the style of Madame de Staël, of Madame
Récamier."</p>

<p>Within this narrow circle of Europe-visiting, highly civilized,
occupationless men and women, James is at his best. Had he not
been reared by Henry James, Senior? Had he not lived his whole
life in the charmed circle of the highly civilized? But once outside
of this small area he ceases to be convincing. Of the great
mass of the American people he knows but little. He has seen
them only at a distance.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As some rich woman, on a winter's morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eyes through her silken curtains the poor drudge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who with numb, blacken'd fingers makes her fire ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wonders how she lives, and what the thoughts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that poor drudge may be,<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">so of James when he attempts to portray the great mass of his
countrymen. One needs to examine only the case of Christopher
Newman in <i>The American</i>. Given a man who left home at eight
years of age to work in the mills, who at length manufactures
wash tubs, then leather, and at last by sheer Yankee impudence
and energy makes himself a millionaire at forty. Thrust this
man suddenly into the circles of French nobility, place him in the
presence of the Countess de Belgrade and ask yourself if he will
talk like this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>She is a woman of conventions and proprieties; her world is the
world of things immutably decreed. But how she is at home in it, and
what a paradise she finds it. She walks about in it as if it were a
blooming park, a Garden of Eden; and when she sees "This is genteel,"
or "This is improper," written on a mile-stone she stops ecstatically, as
if she were listening to a nightingale or smelling a rose.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is not Christopher Newman; this is no American self-made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
man talking; it is Henry James himself. Did he realize his mistake
when his art was more mature and his judgment more ripe?
Collate the changes which he made thirty years later for the final
edition of <i>The American</i>. Newman is asked, for instance, if he
is visiting Europe for the first time. According to the earlier
version he replies, "Very much so"; according to the latest version,
"Quite immensely the first." Is more proof needed? All
his average Americans&mdash;Daisy Miller, Henrietta Stackpole, Casper
Goodwood, and the others, fall short in the same way. Objectively
they are true to life. As a painter of external portraits,
as a depicter of tricks of personality, of manners, of all that
makes up a perfect external likeness, James is surpassed not even
by Howells; but he fails to reach the springs of life. Howells's
Silas Lapham is a living personality; James's Christopher Newman
is a lay figure in Yankee costume. For James knows Americans
chiefly as he has studied them in pensions and hotels along
the grand tour. He has not been introduced to them, he has
simply watched them&mdash;their uneasiness in their new element, their
attempts at adjustment, their odd little mistakes; he hears them
talk at the tables around him&mdash;their ejaculations, their wonder,
their enthusiasm, and he jots it all down. He has no sympathy,
he has no feeling, he has no object, save the scientific desire to
record phenomena.</p>

<p>This material he weaves into novels&mdash;stories, but not stories
told with narrative intent, not stories for entertainment or wonder
or sensation. The story is a clinic, a dissection, a psychological
seminar. <i>What Maisie Knew</i> is an addition to the literature
of child study. It is as if he had set himself to observe case after
case for his brother, William James, to use as materials for psychological
generalizations and a final treatise. The data are often
inaccurate because of the observer's personal equation; it does
not always conform with the results of our own observing&mdash;we
wonder, for instance, if he is as far afield in his pictures of the
European aristocracy as in those of his average Americans&mdash;yet
the process is always the same.</p>

<p>Rapidity of movement is foreign to his method; he is not concerned
with movement. On the portrait of one lady he will expend
two hundred thousand words. Basil in <i>The Bostonians</i>
passes the evening with his Cousin Olive: the call occupies nine
chapters; Verena Tarrant calls on Miss Chancellor: it is two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
chapters before either of them moves or speaks. It transports us
back into the eighteenth century to the nine-volume novel. At
every step analysis, searchings for the springs of thought and act&mdash;philosophizing.
Lord Warburton stands before Miss Archer to
propose marriage, but before we hear his voice we must analyze
minutely his sensations and hers. Her first feeling was alarm.
"This alarm was composed of several elements, not all of which
were disagreeable; she had spent several days in analyzing them,"
etc. A review of this analysis fills a page. Then we study the
psychology of the lover. First, he wonders why he is about to
propose: "He calculated that he had spent about twenty-six
hours in her company. He had summed up all this&mdash;the perversity
of the impulse, the&mdash;" etc., etc. A proposal each step
and speech of which is followed by a careful clinic to determine
the resultant emotion, and a rigid analysis of all the elements
that combined to produce that particular shade of emotion and
no other, can hardly satisfy the demands of the average modern
reader of fiction. It is the province of the novel to produce with
verisimilitude an area of human life and to make the reader for a
swift period at home in that area; it is not the record of a scientific
investigation.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>James has dealt almost wholly with exceptions and unusual
cases. His "Bostonians" are not typical Bostonians at all&mdash;it is
not too strong to declare that they are abnormalities; his "Europeans"
are almost as bad; his characters studied along the
grand tour are rare exceptions if we compare them with the
great average American type. Of strong, elemental men and
women, the personalities shown by novelists like Fielding and
Tolstoy and Hardy and Mark Twain, he knows nothing. He is
feminine rather than masculine; he is exquisite rather than
strong. In his essay on Turgenieff he records that the great
Russian was never one of his admirers. "I do not think my
stories struck him as quite meat for men."</p>

<p>There is a lack, too, of seriousness: the novels really accomplish
nothing. "The manner," according to Turgenieff's opinion, "is
more apparent than the matter." Style is preferred to message.
There is no humor, no stirring of emotions, nothing pitched above
the key of perfect refinement&mdash;the reader does not feel and therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
does not care. It is a mere intellectual exercise, a problem
in psychology.</p>

<p>That James himself was aware of this weakness we learn from
his essay on Daudet. Of Sidonie Chebe he writes, "She is not
<i>felt</i>," and again, "His weakness has been want of acquaintance
with his subject. He has not <i>felt</i> what he has observed." It is
a judgment that sweeps over the whole fiction of Henry James.
He has never been possessed by his subject or by his characters,
he has never been seized and hurried along by his stories, he has
never told them because they had to be told, he has never written
a single sentence with held breath and beating heart, and as a
result his work can never find for long an audience save the select
few; an audience indeed that at length must become as restricted
as that which now reads the exquisite creations of the elder James,
his father.</p>

<p>There is another element that must be weighed before we can
understand fully the work of this writer, an element that is distinctly
classical. The basis underlying all of this mass of analysis
is self-consciousness. Never was author more subjective and
more enamoured of his own psychological processes than Henry
James. Never does he lose sight of himself. These characters of
his are all of them Henry James. They slip out of their costumes
at slightest provocation to talk with his tones, to voice his philosophy,
to follow his mental processes. In externals they are true
to model though not always deeply; the hands are the hands of
Christopher Newman, but the voice is the voice of Henry James.</p>

<p>The tendency to self-consciousness has colored everything.
Even his criticism has had its personal basis. It has consisted
of studies in expatriation: the life of Story, that prototype of
James; the life of Hawthorne, that exposition of the rawness of
America and the unfitness of the new land for the residence of
men of culture; <i>The American Scene</i>&mdash;that mental analysis
tracing every shade of emotion as he revisits what has become to
him a foreign land. His literary essays cover largely the experiences
of his apprenticeship. They trace the path of his own
growth in art. They are strings of brilliants, flashing, often incomparable,
but they are not criticism in the highest sense of the
word criticism. Few men have said such brilliant things about
Balzac, Maupassant, Daudet, Stevenson as James, yet for all that
a critic in the wider sense of the term really he is not. He lacks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
perspective, philosophy, system. He makes epigrams and pithy
remarks. The ability to project himself into the standpoint of
another, to view with sympathy of comprehension, he did not
have. Within his limited range he could measure and the rules
of art he could apply with brilliancy, but he could not feel.</p>

<p>Self-study, the pursuit of every fleeting impression, became in
the author at last a veritable obsession. In his later books like
<i>Notes of a Son and Brother</i>, for instance, and <i>The American
Scene</i>, his finger is constantly upon his own pulse. He seeks the
source of his every fleeting emotion. He does not tell us why he
did not want to enter Harvard; he tries rather to trace the subtle
thread of causation that could have led him not to <i>want</i> to want
to go. When <i>A Small Boy and Others</i> appeared the world cried
out, "Is it possible that at last Henry James has revealed himself?"
whereas the truth was that few men ever have revealed
themselves more. All this endless dissection and analysis and
scrutiny of the inner workings is in reality an analysis of Henry
James himself. Objective he could not be. He could only stand
in his solitude and interpret his own introspections.</p>

<p>And his solitude it has been and his self-contemplation that
have evolved his later manner. A consciously wrought-out style
like Pater's or Maupassant's comes always as a result of solitude,
of self-conscious concentration, of classicism. Eternal contemplation
of manner can result only in mannerism more and
more, until mannerism becomes the ruling characteristic. Classicism
perishes at last of its own refinement.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The evolution of William Dean Howells is a problem vastly different.
To place Howells as a leader of those forces of refinement
that followed after the New England period is seemingly to
ignore the facts of his origin and his early training, for the little
river town on the Ohio where he was born in 1837 was as far
removed from New England manners and sentiments as was even
the Hannibal of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. He was
reared to despise Yankees as a mean-spirited race, and he spent
his childhood and young manhood in close contact with the rough,
virile material that was shaping up the great West.</p>

<p>Howells was of the third generation in Ohio, a Westerner of the
Westerners. His grandfather, a Welsh manufacturer, "came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
this country early in the nineteenth century and settled his family
in a log cabin in the Ohio woods, that they might be safe from
the sinister influences of the village where he was managing some
woolen <span class="locked">mills."<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></span> He finally settled down as a druggist and bookseller
in a small village, and his son, perhaps from contact with
his father's wares, developed a passion for literature&mdash;strange
acquisition, it would seem, to gain in the wilderness.</p>

<p>It was from this literary father rather than from his mother,
who was from the river-faring folk of the region, that the young
William Dean Howells was to derive his early love for books.
He seems to have been a Henry James, Senior, with Southwestern
training and environment and a lack of means that forbade his
following the path of his desires. He too was a Swedenborgian
and a mystic, and he too, despite unfavorable surroundings, kept
in his household a literary atmosphere. Moore's <i>Lalla Rookh</i>,
Thomson's <i>Seasons</i>, Dickens, Scott, Cowper, Burns, he read to
his family&mdash;poetry the most of it, for "his own choice was for
poetry, and most of our library, which was not given to theology,
was given to poetry." An unusual character indeed in the headlong,
practical West of the mid century! While the mother was
about her tasks and the children were shelling peas for dinner,
he would sit and tell of Cervantes and the adventures of Don
Quixote, transporting the little group into castles in Spain, and
creating visions and longings that were to dominate the whole
life of his little son. He watched with pleasure the literary tendencies
of the boy: "when I began to show a liking for literature
he was eager to guide my choice."</p>

<p>The father satisfied his literary longings by editing country
newspapers and serving as reporter at various times at the State
capital during sessions of the legislature. He remained in no
place long. With what Howells has called "the vagarious impulse
which is so strong in our craft," he removed his family to
new fields of labor with surprising regularity. There was little
chance for schooling. Almost from infancy the boy was a part
of his father's printing office. In <i>A Boy's Town</i>, that delightful
autobiographic fragment told in the third person, he has given a
glimpse of this early period:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>My boy was twelve years old by that time and was already a swift
compositor, though he was still so small that he had to stand on a chair
to reach the case in setting type on Tyler's inaugural message. But
what he lacked in stature he made up in gravity of demeanor; and he
got the name of "The Old Man" from the printers as soon as he began
to come about the office, which he did almost as soon as he could walk.
His first attempt in literature, an essay on the vain and disappointing
nature of human life, he set up and printed off himself in his sixth or
seventh year; and the printing office was in some sort his home, as well
as his school, his university. He could no more remember learning to
set type than he could remember learning to read.</p></blockquote>

<p>The autobiographical writings of Howells leave us with the impression
of a gentle, contemplative boy given rather to reading
and dreaming in a solitary corner than to Mark-Twain-like activities
with Tom Sawyers and Huck Finns. Though by birth and
rearing he was a complete Westerner of the river section, mingling
freely with all its elements, he seems never to have taken root
in the region or to have been much influenced by it. He has
spoken somewhere of De Quincey as a man "eliminated from his
time and place by his single love for books." Howells, like
James, was a detached soul. From his earliest youth he was not
a resident of Ohio, but a resident of the vaster world of literature.
He read enormously and with passion, and from his boyhood he
seems&mdash;also like Henry James&mdash;to have had no dream of other
than a literary career. He saw not the headlong West that
surged about him but the realms of poetry and romance. "To
us who have our lives so largely in books," he wrote in later
years, "the material world is always the fable, and the ideal the
fact. I walked with my feet on the ground, but my head was in
the clouds, as light as any of them.... I was living in a time of
high political tumult, and I certainly cared very much for the
question of slavery which was then filling the minds of men; I
felt deeply the shame and wrong of our fugitive slave law; I was
stirred by the news from Kansas, where the great struggle between
the two great principles in our nationality was beginning
in bloodshed; but I cannot pretend that any of these things were
more than ripples on the surface of my intense and profound interest
in <span class="locked">literature."<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>It is suggestive that his earliest "passions" among the authors
were Goldsmith, Irving, and Cervantes, and later Pope, Macaulay,
and Curtis&mdash;the most of them literary artists and finishers, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
grace of style and softness and dreaminess of atmosphere, rather
than stormy creators who blazed new trails and crashed into the
unknown with lawless power. He taught himself the use of literary
English by painstaking imitation of the classics which took
his young fancy. His passion for Pope was long continued.
When other boys in the schools were shirking their English grammar,
Howells week after week and month after month was toiling
at imitations of the great master of incisive English, "rubbing and
polishing at my wretched verses till they did sometimes take on
an effect, which, if it was not like Pope's, was like none of mine."
From him "I learned how to choose between words after a study
of their fitness." Juveniles and boys' books of adventure he
seems never to have known. From the first he was enamoured of
the classics, and of the classics best fitted to educate him for the
career that was to be his: "my reading from the first was such as
to enamour me of clearness, of definiteness."</p>

<p>Never was youth more industrious in his efforts at self-mastery.
He wasted not a moment. He discovered Macaulay and read him
as most boys read pirate stories. "Of course I reformed my prose
style, which had been carefully modeled after that of Goldsmith
and Irving, and began to write in the manner of Macaulay, in
short, quick sentences and with the prevalent use of brief Anglo-Saxon
words." His health began to suffer from his application,
but he worked steadily on. He produced quantities of poems and
even a novel or two which he either destroyed or consigned to
the oblivion of the newspaper upon which he worked. Later he
enlarged the field of his literary apprenticeship by securing a
position on a Columbus journal, or as he has himself expressed it,
he was "for three years a writer of news paragraphs, book notices,
and political leaders on a daily paper in an inland <span class="locked">city."<a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></span> Then
he began to enlarge his literary field by contributing "poems and
sketches and criticisms for the <i>Saturday Press</i> of New <span class="locked">York."<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>In December, 1859, he issued his first book, <i>Poems of Two
Friends</i>, a small volume of rather ordinary verses written in conjunction
with J.&nbsp;J. Piatt, and a few months later he published a
campaign life of Abraham Lincoln, a book more notable for its
effect upon its author's fortunes than for any quality it may have
had, for it was as a result of it that he was sent in 1861 to Italy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
for a glorious four years of graduate study, if we may so term it,
in Italian literature and language and life.</p>

<p>One cannot dwell too carefully upon these years of Howells's
literary apprenticeship. As one reads his published work one
finds from the first no immaturities. He burst upon the reading
public as a finished writer. When his work first began to appear
in the East, the <i>North American Review</i> of Boston voiced its astonishment:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We made occasion to find out something about him, and what we
learned served to increase our interest. This delicacy, it appeared, was
a product of the rough and ready West, this finish the natural gift of a
young man with no advantage of college training, who, passing from
the compositor's desk to the editorship of a local newspaper, had been
his own faculty of the humanities. But there are some men who are
born <span class="locked">cultivated.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>But Howells was not born cultivated; he achieved cultivation
by a process of self-discipline that has few parallels in the history
of literature. He is a classicist as James is a classicist. If his
style is clear and concise, if he knows as few modern authors the
resources of the English tongue, it is because he gave without reserve
to the mastering of it all the enthusiasm and time and
strength of his youth and young manhood. He was not a genius:
he was a man of talent of the Pope-Macaulay order that makes of
literature not a thing of inspirations and flashes and visions, but
a profession to be learned as one learns the pipe organ after years
of practice, as an art demanding an exquisite skill to be gained
only by unremitting toil.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>The Howells of the earlier period was a poet. Speaking of the
winter of 1859-60, which saw the publication of his first volume,
he writes: "It seemed to me as if the making and the reading
of poetry were to go on forever, and that was to be all there was
to it." "Inwardly I was a poet, with no wish to be anything
else, unless in a moment of careless affluence I might so far forget
myself as to be a novelist."</p>

<p>His reading more and more was in the poets. Heine he read
with passion, and Longfellow and Tennyson, and then Heine,
evermore Heine. "Nearly ten years afterwards Mr. Lowell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
wrote me about something of mine that he had been reading:
'You must sweat the Heine out of your bones as men do mercury.'"
The seven poems which Lowell accepted and printed
in the <i>Atlantic</i> in 1860 and 1861 are redolent of Heine, with
here and there traces of Longfellow. When he came East just
before his appointment to Venice it was as a poet, and a poet
making a pilgrimage to the mother-land of poesy.</p>

<p>New England was to him indeed a land of dreams and romance.
"As the passionate pilgrim from the West," to use his own words,
"approached his Holy Land at Boston," he felt like putting the
shoes from off his feet. New England was the home of Emerson
and Longfellow and Holmes, of Whittier and Hawthorne and
Lowell, and all the <i>Atlantic</i> immortals, and he appreciated it as
Irving and Willis had appreciated old England earlier in the
century, or as Longfellow and Taylor had appreciated the continent
of Europe.</p>

<p>Following this passionate pilgrimage with its glimpses of the
New England Brahmins, came the transfer of the young Westerner
to Venice, "the Chief City," as he somewhere has termed
it, "of sentiment and fantasy." It was like stepping from the
garish light of to-day into the pages of an old romance. The
duties of his office were light, the salary was fifteen hundred dollars
a year, and he was enabled to give, to use his own words,
"nearly four years of nearly uninterrupted leisure" to a study
of Italian literature and to poetic composition. We may catch
glimpses of what the four years meant to the eager young Westerner
in <i>A Foregone Conclusion</i> and <i>A Fearful Responsibility</i>,
stories that center about an American consul at Venice. The
poetic quality of the period was heightened in the second year
of his official life by his marriage&mdash;spring and Venice and a bride
with whom to share them&mdash;no wonder that he completed a long
poem in <i>terza rima</i>, "dealing," as he has expressed it, "with a
story of our Civil War in a fashion so remote that no editor
would print it," and that he deluged the magazines of two continents
with poems and poetic sketches.</p>

<p>For the earlier Howells was a poet&mdash;until one realizes it one
fails completely to understand him. He turned from poetry
reluctantly, compelled by the logic of his time and by the fact
that he had no compelling message for his age. He was of the
contemplative, classical school, more at home in the eighteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
century than in the stormy nineteenth. He published in 1867
<i>No Love Lost, A Romance of Travel</i>, in unrimed pentameters,
a refined, leisurely poem classical in form and spirit. He issued
editions of his poems in 1873 and 1886, and again as late as
1895, but the age refused to regard him as a poet and he was
forced into other fields. "My literary life," he observes almost
sadly as he reviews his Venetian period, "almost without my
willing it, had taken the course of critical observance of books
and men in their <span class="locked">actuality."<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>From poetry Howells turned to sketches, a variety of composition
which he had cultivated since his boyhood. Irving had
been one of his earliest passions, and following Irving had come
Ik Marvel and Hawthorne and Curtis&mdash;gentle, contemplative
writers with the light of poetry upon their work. Even like
Irving and Longfellow and Taylor, he would record the strange
new world in which he found himself. "I was bursting with the
most romantic expectations of life in every way, and I looked
at the whole world as material that might be turned into literature."
He lived note-book in hand. Everything was new and
entrancing, even the talk of servants on the street or the babble
of children at their play. It was all so new, so romantic, so removed
from the world that he always had known. He would
reproduce it in its naked truth for his countrymen; he would
turn it all into literature for the magazines of America, and he
would republish it at length as a new <i>Sketch Book</i>.</p>

<p><i>Venetian Life</i> belongs on the same shelf as <i>Outre Mer</i> and
<i>Views Afoot</i> and <i>Castilian Days</i>&mdash;prose sketches with the golden
light of youth upon them. <i>Italian Journeys</i> is the first and best
of a long series of sentimental "bummelings" that its author was
to record&mdash;delicious ramblings, descriptions, characterizations&mdash;realistic
studies, we may call them, made by a poet. Nothing
that Howells ever wrote has been better than these earlier travel
sketches, half poetry, half shrewd observation. In his later
travel sketches&mdash;<i>Tuscan Cities</i>, <i>London Films</i>, <i>Certain Delightful
English Towns</i>, and the like&mdash;this element grew constantly less
and less. Wiser they undoubtedly are, and more scholarly and
philosophic, but the freshness and poetic charm of the earlier
Howells is not in them. The philosopher has taken the place of
the poet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span></p>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>The first period of Howells's literary life, the period of sketches
and prose studies, covers the fifteen years of his connection with
the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, first from 1866 to 1871 as assistant editor,
and then from 1871 to 1881 as editor. He had returned from
Venice a cosmopolitan and an accomplished Italian scholar.
There was no trace of the West upon him; it was as if he had
always lived in Boston. His sketches now centered about Cambridge
life, just as earlier they had centered upon Italian themes&mdash;careful
little character studies like "Mrs. Johnson" and "My
Doorstep Acquaintance," little sentimental journeys like "A Pedestrian
Tour" and "A Day's Pleasure," and chatty talks about
himself and his opinions and experiences, something after the
manner of Dr. Holmes, a variety of composition in which he was
to grow voluminous in later years.</p>

<p>His book reviewing in the <i>Atlantic</i> during this period is notable
from the fact that almost all of the chief works of the new national
period of which he was a part passed under his pen.
Freshness and truth and originality never failed to arrest his
attention; he was a real force in the directing of the <i>Atlantic</i>
element of the American reading public toward the rising new
school of authors, but aside from this his criticism is in no way
significant. His art and his enthusiasm were in his sketches&mdash;American
sketches now with the light of Europe over them.
<i>Their Wedding Journey</i> is an American counterpart to <i>Italian
Journeys</i>, and it is made coherent by introducing a married pair
on their bridal tour and describing places and manners as they
became acquainted with them. The interest comes not at all
from the narrative; it comes from the setting. It is an American
sentimental journey over which the author strives to throw the
soft light of European romance. Rochester was like Verona;
and Quebec&mdash;"on what perverse pretext was it not some ancient
town of Normandy?"</p>

<p>Sketches, pictures of life, studies of manners, these are the
object of the book. The author is not writing to record incidents,
for there are few incidents to record. "That which they [the
bridal pair] found the most difficult of management," he declares,
"was the want of incident for the most part of the time; and I
who write their history might also sink under it, but that I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
supported by the fact that it is so typical in this respect. I even
imagine the ideal reader for whom one writes as yawning over
these barren details with the life-like weariness of an actual
traveling companion of theirs."</p>

<p>As a story from the standpoint of Bonner's <i>New York Ledger</i>,
then in the high tide of its prosperity, it was dreary reading.
But it was true in every line, true of background, and true to the
facts of human life as Howells saw those facts. "Ah! poor real
life, which I love," he exclaims, after a minute sketch of a commercial
traveler and some loud-voiced girls on the train, "can I
make others share the delight I share in thy foolish and insipid
face?"</p>

<p>But this earlier Howells gives us more than real life: he gives
us real life touched with the glow of poetry, for the poet in Howells
died a lingering death. It seems as if novel-writing had come
to him, as he declares all of his literary life had come, almost
without his willing it. It grew gradually and naturally out of
his sketch-writing. In his early sketch books he had studied
places and "men in their actuality," and he would now make
his sketches more comprehensive and bind them with a thread
of narrative. A sketch like "A Day's Outing" in <i>Suburban
Sketches</i>, and a "novel" like <i>Their Wedding Journey</i> differ only
in the single element of quantity. <i>A Chance Acquaintance</i>, the
record of another sentimental journey, with its careful sketches
along the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay, and at Quebec, and its
<i>Pride-and-Prejudice</i>-like study of a typical Bostonian and a
Western girl, has more of story than the earlier book, but it is still
a sketch book rather than a novel. <i>Private Theatricals</i>, his
fourth essay at fiction, is so minute a study of a particular summer
boarding house and its patrons that it was never allowed to
get beyond serial publication, at least one can think of no other
reason for its suppression, and <i>The Undiscovered Country</i> might
be entitled <i>Sketches Among the Spiritualists and the Shakers</i>.</p>

<p>The Howells of this earlier period has little of story and little
of problem. His object is to present men and manners "in their
actuality." <i>A Foregone Conclusion</i>, the most idyllic of his
novels, in reality is an added chapter to <i>Venetian Life</i>, written
in the retrospect of later years. The golden light of Venice is
over it, a Venice now more mellow and poetic because it is a part
of the author's vanishing youth&mdash;his <i>alma mater</i>, as it were;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
more golden every year. The springtime is in every page of it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The day was one of those that can come to the world only in early
June at Venice. The heaven was without a cloud, but a blue haze
made mystery of the horizon where the lagoon and sky met unseen.
The breath of the sea bathed in freshness the city at whose feet her
tides sparkled and slept.... The long garland of vines that festoons
all Italy seemed to begin in the neighboring orchards; the meadows
waved their long grasses in the sun, and broke in poppies as the sea-waves
break in iridescent spray; the poplars marched in stately procession
on either side of the straight, white road to Padua, till they
vanished in the long perspective.</p></blockquote>

<p>One loves to linger over this early Howells, despite all his diffuseness
and his lack of dramatic power. One knows that there
is a fatal weakness in the attempted tragedy of the priest, that
the tale does not grip and compel and haunt the soul as such a
tale must if it be worth telling at all, that its ending is sprawling
and conventional, and yet one cannot but feel that there is in it,
as there is in all of the work of this earlier period of the author's
life, youth and freshness and beauty&mdash;and poetry. These earlier
studies are not merely cold observations upon life and society,
analysis as of reactions in a test-tube; these are the creations of a
young poet, a romancer, a dreamer: the later manner was an
artificial acquirement like the taste for olives.</p>

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>Howells's second literary period begins with the year 1881
when he resigned the editorship of the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> and
settled in the country at Belmont to devote all his time to the
writing of fiction for the <i>Century</i> magazine. During the decade
that followed he produced his two strongest works, <i>A Modern
Instance</i>, and <i>The Rise of Silas Lapham</i>, and also <i>A Woman's
Reason</i>, <i>The Minister's Charge</i>, <i>Indian Summer</i>, and others.
He had found his life work. During the earlier period he had
been, as it were, experimenting; he had published fifteen books,
only five of which were novels, but it was clear now that the five
pointed the way he was to go.</p>

<p>He began now with larger canvas and with more sweep and
freedom. No more idyllic sketches now: his business was to
make studies at full length of American character and American
manners. He would do for New England what Jane Austen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
had done for her narrow little corner of old England. He too
had "the exquisite touch," to use the words of Sir Walter Scott,
"which renders ordinary commonplace things and characters interesting
from the truth of the description and the sentiment."
Like her he would bring no message and analyze no passion more
intense than the perplexity of a maiden with two lovers; and like
her he would deal not with the problems of the soul of man, but
with the manners of a small province.</p>

<p>His essay on Henry James in the <i>Century</i> of November, 1882,
the proclamation of the new Howells, raised a tempest of discussion
that did not subside for a decade. "The stories," he declared,
"were all told long ago; and now we want to know merely
what the novelist thinks about persons and situations." "The art
of fiction has become a finer art in our day than it was with
Dickens and Thackeray. We could not suffer the confidential
attitude of the latter now, nor the mannerism of the former, any
more than we could endure the prolixity of Richardson or the
coarseness of Fielding. These great men are of the past&mdash;they
and their methods and interests; even Trollope and Reade are
not of the present." And of the new novel&mdash;"The moving accident
is certainly not its trade; and it prefers to avoid all manner
of dire catastrophes." James he classified not as a story-teller,
but as a character-painter, and he proceeded to set forth the
thesis that "the novelist's main business is to possess his reader
with a due conception of his characters and the situations in which
they find themselves. If he does more or less than this he equally
fails." "It is, after all, what a writer has to say rather than
what he has to tell that we care for now-a-days."</p>

<p>But the Howells of the eighties was not ready yet for grounds
so advanced when it came to his own work. The romancer within
him died hard. "I own," he admitted, "that I like a finished
story," and he proceeded to tell finished stories with plots and
moving accidents and culminating ends. <i>A Woman's Reason</i>
is as elaborate in plot and incident as a novel by Mrs. Braddon,
and it has as conventional an ending. The heroine, apparently
deserted by her lover, is forced to live in a humble boarding
house where she is wooed persistently by a member of the English
nobility. She is true, however, to her old lover, who after
having lived years on a desert island which for a time we are permitted
to share with him, returns at last to rescue her, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
marriage crowns the book with gold. <i>A Modern Instance</i> and
<i>The Rise of Silas Lapham</i>, undoubtedly his strongest work, are
first of all stories, and to the great majority of all who have ever
read them they have been <i>only</i> stories. In other words, they have
been read for what the author had to tell, and not necessarily for
what he has had to say.</p>

<p>He has been careful always that his tales end well, as careful
indeed as an E.&nbsp;P. Roe. The ending of <i>A Foregone Conclusion</i>
and of <i>The Minister's Charge</i> fly in the very face of realism.
He is bold in his theories, but in the application of these theories to
his own work he has an excess of timidity. Realism should flout
the conventionalities; it should have regard only for the facts in
the case, affect the reader as they may, but Howells had continually
on his mind the readers of the <i>Atlantic</i> and the nerves of
the "Brahmins." The end of <i>An Imperative Duty</i>, for instance,
could have come only as a concession to the conventional reader.
He allows the woman with the negro blood to marry the man
she loves, and then hastens to say that they lived the rest of their
lives in Italy, where such matches are not criticized and where the
woman passed everywhere as an Italian. It would have been
stronger art to have made her rise superior to her selfishness,
the soul triumphant over the flesh, and refuse to marry the man,
and to do it for the sole compelling reason that she loved him.</p>

<p>The much-discussed realism of the Howells of the eighties was
simply a demand for truth, an insistence that all characters and
backgrounds be drawn from nature, and that no sequence of
events be given that might not happen in the life of the average
man. His stories therefore, like James's, move slowly. There
is much in them of what is technically called "lumber"&mdash;material
that is brought in for other reasons than to advance the
progress of the story. Every character is minutely described;
cravats and waistcoats, hats and watch-charms, dresses and furbelows,
are dwelt upon with thoroughness. The author stops the
story to describe a carpet, a wardrobe, a peculiarity of gesture.
A page is taken up with a description of the heroine's drawing-room,
another is given to the view from her window. As a result
we get from the reading of the book, in spite of our impatience
at its slow movement, a feeling of actuality. Bartley

him on Tremont Street. Silas Lapham, the typical self-made
American of the era, and his wife and daughters, are speaking
likenesses, done with sympathy; for the early years of Howells
had enabled him, unlike James, to enter into bourgeois life with
comprehension. Everywhere portraits done with a thousand
careful touches&mdash;New England types largely drawn against a
minute background of manners.</p>

<p>It cannot fail that these novels, even like those of Jane Austen,
will be valued in years to come as historical documents. As
a picture of the externals of the era they portray there is nothing
to compare with them. The Boston of the seventies, gone now
as completely as the Boston of the Revolution, lives in these
pages. Every phase of its external life has been dwelt upon:
its underworld and its lodging houses and its transformed country
boys in <i>The Minister's Charge</i>; the passing of the old Boston
of the India trade days and the helplessness of the daughters
of the patricians in <i>A Woman's Reason</i>; literary and journalistic
Boston in <i>A Modern Instance</i>; the high and low of Boston society
in <i>The Rise of Silas Lapham</i>; the entry of woman into the
learned professions in <i>Dr. Breen's Practice</i>, and so on and on&mdash;he
has covered the field with the faithfulness of a sociological historian.
He is a painter of manners, evermore manners.</p>

<p>As to whether or not he touched the soul of New England as
did Rose Terry Cooke, for instance, is another question. His
knowledge of the region was an acquirement, not a birthright.
The surface of its society, the peculiarities of its manners and its
point of view, the unusual traits of its natives, these he saw with
the sharpened eyes of an outsider, but he never became so much
a part of what he wrote that he could treat it, as Mrs. Wilkins-Freeman
treated it, from the heart outward. The thing perhaps
that impressed him first and most deeply as he came a stranger
into the provincial little area was the so-called New England conscience,
"grim aftercrop of Puritanism, that hypochondria of
the soul into which the Puritanism of her father's race had sickened
in her, and which so often seems to satisfy its crazy claim
upon conscience by enforcing some aimless act of self <span class="locked">sacrifice."<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></span>
All of his New England characters have this as their humor,
using the word in the Ben Jonsonian sense. Novels like <i>A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
Woman's Reason</i> and <i>The Minister's Charge</i> turn upon it. With
Hawthorne the thing became a moving power, a tragic center of
his art that could move the soul to pity or to terror, but Howells
treats it never with the sympathy of comprehension. He never
so treats it that we feel it; he never shows us a character possessed
by its power until it is driven over the brink of tragedy.
It is simply one of the details that make up the portrait of a
New Englander, as in <i>The Lady of the Aroostook</i>, the maiden
cries out at the happy moment when her lover declares himself:
"'Oh, I knew it, I knew it,' cried Lydia. And then, as he
caught her to him at last, 'Oh&mdash;Oh&mdash;are you <i>sure</i> it's right?'"
It is an element of manners, a picturesque peculiarity, a "humor."</p>

<h3>X</h3>

<p>In his first period Howells was poetic and spontaneous, in his
second he was deliberate and artistic, in his third he was scientific
and ethical. The last period began in a general way at the
opening of the nineties with the publication, perhaps, of <i>A
Hazard of New Fortunes</i>. He had spent another year in Europe,
and in 1886 had removed to New York to do editorial work
for the Harpers.</p>

<p>Now began what undoubtedly was the most voluminous literary
career in the history of American literature. He took
charge of the "Easy Chair" in <i>Harper's Monthly</i>, writing for
it material equivalent to a volume a year, and in addition he
poured out novels, books of travel, sketches, reviews, juveniles,
autobiographies, comedies, farces, essays, editings, biographies&mdash;a
mass of material equaled in bulk only by the writings of men
like Southey or Dumas. He had learned his art with completeness.
The production of clear and precise and brilliant English
had become second nature, and he could pour it out steadily and
with speed.</p>

<p>His novels more and more now began to conform to his realistic
theories. The story sank gradually from prominence, and
gradually analysis and scientific purpose took its place. <i>Annie
Kilburn</i>, 1888, may be taken as the point of transition. The
story could be told in a single chapter. There is no love-making,
no culminating marriage or engagement, no passion, no crime,
no violence greater than the flashing of eyes, no mystery, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
climax. It is the afternoon talk of the ladies of a rural parish.
For chapter after chapter they babble on, assisted now and then
by the doctor or the minister or the lawyer who drops in for a cup
of tea. As in the work of James, one may turn a dozen pages
and find the same group still refining upon the same theme over
the same tea-cups. The object of the author is not progress in
events, but progress in characterization and ethical analysis.
Through the mouths of these talkers he is discussing the problems
of the rural church and the rural community. He attempts to
settle nothing finally, but he sets the problem before the reader
in all its phases, and the reader may come to his own conclusion.</p>

<p>This novel is typical of all the fiction of the later Howells.
Everywhere now problems&mdash;moral, social, psychological&mdash;problems
discussed by means of endless dialogue. <i>A Hazard of New
Fortunes</i> is almost as long as <i>Pamela</i>, and when it is ended there
is no logical reason for the ending save that the novelist has used
the space allotted to him. Another volume could easily have
been added telling of the experiences of the Dreyfooses in Europe.
The novelist may stop at any point, for he is not telling
a story, he is painting character, and manners and developing
a thesis. In <i>Annie Kilburn</i> the effect of the sudden ending is
disconcerting. It is like the cutting off of a yard of cloth.</p>

<p>Howells had passed under the powerful influence of Tolstoy.
"As much as one merely human being can help another," he declares,
"I believe that he has helped me; he has not influenced
me in esthetics only, but in ethics, too, so that I can never again
see life in the way I saw it before I knew him." It is absurd,
however, to think that any influence could fundamentally have
changed the art of a man like Howells in his fiftieth year. What
Tolstoy did for him was to confirm and deepen tendencies in his
work that already had become established and to turn his mind
from the contemplation exclusively of manners and men in their
actuality to problems ethical and social. He gave to him a message
and a wider view of art. "What I feel sure is that I can
never look at life in the mean and sordid way that I did before
I read Tolstoy." "He has been to me that final consciousness,
which he speaks of so wisely in his essay on 'Life.'"</p>

<p>As an example of this final Howells we may read <i>The Landlord
of Lion's Head</i>, or <i>The Traveler from Altruria</i>, or <i>The Quality
of Mercy</i>, which are not so much novels as minute studies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
social or moral phases of the times, illustrated by means of a
particular case and made clear by voluminous details. Minor
characters serve as a chorus as the case proceeds, and the final
effect is sermonic rather than novelistic. The poetic and the
esthetic have yielded to the ethical and socialistic. In America
every art ends at last in a sermon.</p>

<h3>XI</h3>

<p>The realism of Howells is of the eighteenth-century type rather
than the nineteenth. It is classicism, as Henry James's is classicism.
His affinity is with Richardson rather than with Zola.
He was timid and conscious of his audience. He had approached
Boston with too much of reverence; the "tradition of the <i>Atlantic</i>"
lay heavily upon him during all of his earlier period;
the shadow of Lowell was upon his page and he wrote as in his
presence; the suggestive words in a review of one of his earlier
books by the <i>North American Review</i>, final voice of New England
refinement, compelled him: "He has the incapacity to be common."
Thus his early writings had in them nothing of the
Western audacity and newness. A realistic reaction from the
romantic school of the early nineteenth century was everywhere&mdash;on
the Continent, in England, in America&mdash;changing literary
standards; Howells felt it and yielded to it, but he yielded only
as Longfellow would have yielded had he been of his generation,
or Holmes, or Lowell. He yielded to a modified realism, a timid
and refined realism, a realism that would not offend the sensibilities
of Boston, the "Boston," to quote from <i>A Chance Acquaintance</i>,
"that would rather perish by fire and sword than
to be suspected of vulgarity; a critical, fastidious, reluctant
Boston, dissatisfied with the rest of the hemisphere." He records
scarcely a crime in all his volumes: he has not in his voluminous
gallery a woman who ever broke a law more serious than indiscretions
at an afternoon tea. As a result there is no remorse, no
problems of life in the face of broken law, no decisions that involve
life and death and the agony that is sharper than death.
In his pages life is an endless comedy where highly conventional
and very refined people meet day after day and talk, and dream
of Europe, and make love in the leisurely, old-fashioned way,
and marry happily in the end the lover of their choice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
He is as tedious as Richardson and at times nearly as voluminous.
He uses page after page of <i>The Lady of the Aroostook</i>
to tell what might have been told in a single sentence. The
grandfather and the aunt set the general situation before the
reader, then the aunt and the clergymen, then the two passengers,
then the passengers and the captain, then the heroine and the
cabin boy in six pages, and finally at the very end of the book
the heroine and the transplanted New England woman in Venice.
Art is "nothing too much." We feel instinctively that the author
is making a mountain out of a molehill because he believes
his readers will expect him to do it. To Bostonians he believes it
would be inexpressibly shocking for a girl to sail for Europe the
only woman on board the ship, though she be under the express
care of the fatherly old sea captain and though two of the three
other passengers are Boston gentlemen. The perturbation of
these two model young men, their heroic nerving of themselves to
live through the experience, their endless refinings and analyzings
of the situation, and all of their subsequent doings are simply
Howells's conception of "the quality of Boston."</p>

<p>It is Richardsonism; it is realism of the <i>Pamela</i> order; it is
a return to the eighteenth century with its reverence for respectability
and the conventions, its dread of letting itself go and making
scenes, its avoidance of all that would shock the nerves of
the refined circle for which it wrote. The kinship of Howells
with Richardson indeed is closer even than that between Howells
and James. They approach life from the same angle. Both
profess to deal with men and manners in their actuality, both
would avoid the moving accident and discard from their fictions
all that is fantastic or improbable; both would keep closely
within the circle of the highly respectable middle-class society
of which they were a part; both professed to work with no other
than a moral purpose; and both would reveal the inner life of
their characters only as the reader might infer it after having
read endless descriptions and interminable conversations; and
both wrote, as Tennyson termed <i>Pamela</i> and <i>Clarissa</i>, "great
still books" that flow on and on with sluggish current to no particular
destination.</p>

<p>Howells is less dramatic than Richardson, yet one may turn
pages and chapters of his novels into dramatic form by supplying
to the dialogue the names of the speakers. Howells, indeed, acquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
a faculty in the construction of sparkling dialogue so brilliant
that he exercised it in the production of a surprising number
of so-called comedies: <i>A Counterfeit Presentiment</i>, <i>The
Mouse-Trap</i>, <i>The Elevator</i>, and the like, dramatic in form but
essentially novelistic in all things else. His genius was not dramatic.
He evolves his characters and situations slowly. The
swift rush and culminating plot of the drama are beyond him.
His comedies are chapters of dialogue from unwritten novels&mdash;studies
in character and manners by means of conversations.</p>

<p>Richardson's novels centered about women; they were written
<i>for</i> women; they were praised first of all for their minute knowledge
of the feminine heart. There was indeed in his own nature
a feminine element that made him the absolute opposite of a
masculine type, for instance like Fielding. Howells also centered
his work about women. In one of the earliest reviews of his work
is the sentence "his knowledge of women is simply marvelous."
Like his earlier prototype, he has expended upon them a world
of analysis and dissection and description. With what result?
To one who has read all of his fictions straight through there
emerges at last from the helpless, fluttering, hesitating, rapturous
and dejected, paradoxical, April-hoping, charming throng of his
heroines&mdash;Mrs. March, Kitty Ellison, Lydia, Marcia, Mrs. Campbell,
Mrs. Roberts, Helen Harkness, Florida, Mrs. Lapham and
her daughters, Dr. Breen, Clara Kingsbury, Rhoda Aldgate, Annie
Kilburn, Mrs. Dreyfoos and the hundred others&mdash;there
emerges a single woman, the Howells type, as distinct a creature
as the Richardson type, and as one compares the two he is startled
to find them almost identical. The Richardson feminine is a
trembling, innocent, helpless creature pursued by men; the Howells
type is the same woman transported into the nineteenth century,
inconsequent, temperamental, often bird-like and charming,
electric at repartee, pursued by men and fleeing flutteringly from
them, yet dependent upon them for her very existence. In all
of these fictions there is scarcely a feminine figure, at least in a
leading rôle, of whom her sex may be proud. His masculine
characters are many of them strong and admirable, even to the
minor figures like Mr. Harkness and Captain Butler and Squire
Gaylord. He has, perhaps, created two characters&mdash;Silas Lapham
and Bartly Hubbard&mdash;to place beside Natty Bumppo, and
Uncle Remus, and Yuba Bill, Sam Lawson, Colonel Sellers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
a few others, as permanent additions to the gallery of American
types. But with all his studies of women he has added nothing
original, no type that can be accepted as characteristic or admirable.</p>

<h3>XII</h3>

<p>The art of Howells is essentially of this present world. Of
the soul of man and the higher life of his dreams and aspirations
he has nothing to tell. He writes of Hawthorne: "In all his
books there is the line of thoughts that we think of only in the
presence of the mysteries of life and death. It is not his fault
that this is not intelligence, that it knots the brow in sore doubt
rather than shapes the lips to utterance of the things that can
never be said." Howells would ignore such themes. He is of
the age of doubt, the classical age, rather than of the age of faith
that sees and creates. Lightly he skims over the surface of material
things, noting the set of a garment or the shade of a cravat,
recording rather than creating, interested in life only as it is
affected by manners, sketching with rapid pen characters evolved
by a provincial environment, tracing with leisurely thoroughness
the love story of a boy and girl, recording the April changes of a
maiden's heart, the gossip of an afternoon tea&mdash;a feminine task
one would suppose, work for a Fanny Burney, a Maria Edgeworth
or a Mrs. Gaskell, no work indeed for a great novelist at the
dawn of a new period in a new land. While the West, of which
his earlier life was a part, was crashing out a new civilization;
while the air was electric with the rush and stir of rising cities;
while a new star of hope for the nations was rising in the West;
while a mighty war of freedom was waging about him and the
soul of man was being tried as by fire, Howells, like Clarissa Harlowe,
is interested "in her ruffles, in her gloves, her samplers,
her aunts and uncles."</p>

<p>And yet even as we class him as a painter of manners we
remember that America has no manners in the narrower sense of
the term. New England had the nearest approach to manners,
yet New England, all must admit, was wholly imitative; she was
enamoured of Europe. Howells has another side to his classicism,
one utterly wanting in Richardson&mdash;he is a satirist of manners, a
critic and a reformer. Richardson took English manners as he
took the English Constitution and the English language as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
matter of course. He never dreamed of changing the order of
things; he would only portray it and teach individuals how best
to deport themselves under its laws. Howells, after his first awe
of New England had subsided, became critical. He would
change manners; he would portray them that men by seeing them
would learn their ridiculousness&mdash;in short, he became, what every
classicist must sooner or later become, a satirist&mdash;a chafer under
the conventions that bind him,&mdash;a critic.</p>

<p>Howells then is the rare figure of a lyric poet and a romanticist
who deliberately forced himself into classicism as a result of his
environment. His earlier works are the record of a transition&mdash;enthusiasm,
poetic glow, romance, tempered more and more with
scientific exactness and coldness and skill. Like James, he learned
his profession with infinite toil; like James, he formed himself
upon masters and then defended his final position with a summary
of the laws of his art. Like James, he schooled himself to
distrust the emotions and work wholly from the intellect. The
result in the case of both, in the case of all classicists in fact, has
been that the reader is touched only in the intellect. One smiles
at the flashes of wit; one seldom laughs. No one ever shed a tear
over a page either of Howells or James. One admires their skill;
one takes a certain pleasure in the lifelikeness of the characters&mdash;especially
those of Howells&mdash;but cold lifelikeness is not the supreme
object of art; manners and outward behavior are but a
small part of life. Unless the novelist can lay hold of his reader's
heart and walk with him with sympathy and conviction he must
be content to be ranked at last as a mere showman and not a
voice, not a leader, not a prophet.</p>

<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>Howells, like James, was peculiarly a product of the later nineteenth
century and of the wave of democracy in literature that
came both to Europe and America as a reflex from the romanticism
of Scott and Coleridge and the German <i>Sturm und Drang</i>.
Had he lived a generation earlier he would have been a poet of
the Dr. Holmes type, an Irving, or a George William Curtis.
The spirit of the times and a combination of circumstances made
of him the leader of the depicters of democracy in America.
From the vantage point of the three leading magazines of the
period he was enabled to command a wide audience and to exert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
enormous influence. His beautiful style disarmed criticism and
concealed the leanness of his output. Had he been less timid,
had he dared like Mark Twain or Whitman to forget the fastidious
circle within which he lived, and write with truth and honesty
and sincerity the great nation-wide story with its passion,
its tragedy, its comedy, its tremendous significance in the history
of humanity, he might have led American fiction into fields far
broader than those into which it finally settled.</p>

<p>In the process of the new literary discovery of America Howells's
part was to discover the prosaic ordinary man of the middle
class and to make him tolerable in fiction. He was the leading
force in the reaction against the Sylvanus Cobb type of romance
that was so powerful in America in the early seventies. He made
the new realism respectable. All at once America found that she
was full of material for fiction. Hawthorne had taught that the
new world was barren of material for the novelist, Cooper had
limited American fiction to the period of the settlement and the
Revolution; Longfellow and Taylor had turned to romantic Europe.
After Howells's minute studies of the New England middle
class, every provincial environment in America produced its
recorder, and the novel of locality for a time dominated American
literature.</p>

<p>In another and more decided way, perhaps, Howells was
a potent leader during the period. He has stood for finished
art, for perfection of style, for literary finish, for perfect English
in an age of slovenliness and slang. No writer of the period
has excelled him in accuracy of diction, in brilliancy of expression,
in unfailing purity of style. There is an eighteenth-century
fastidiousness about every page that he has written.</p>

<p>The tribute of Mark Twain is none too strong: "For forty
years his English has been to me a continual delight and astonishment.
In the sustained exhibition of certain great qualities&mdash;clearness,
compression, verbal exactness, and unforced and seemingly
unconscious felicity of phrasing&mdash;he is, in my belief, without
peer in the English-speaking world. <i>Sustained.</i> I entrench myself
behind that protecting word. There are others who exhibit
those qualities as greatly as does he, but only by intervaled distributions
of rich moonlight, with stretches of veiled and dimmer
landscape between, whereas Howells's moon sails cloudless skies
all night and all the nights."</p>

<span class="subhead">RECORDERS OF THE NEW ENGLAND DECLINE</span></h2>

<p>The New England school, which had so dominated the mid-nineteenth
century, left, as we have seen, no heirs. As the great
figures of the "Brahmins" disappeared one by one, vigorous
young leaders from without the Boston circle came into their
places, but the real succession&mdash;the native New England literary
generation after Emerson&mdash;was feminine. During the decade
from 1868 the following books, written by women born, the most
of them, in those thirties which had witnessed the beginnings of
the earlier group, came from the American press:</p>

<p>Of the same generation, but earlier or else later in the literary
field, were the poets Elizabeth Akers Allen (1832&ndash;1911), and
Louise Chandler Moulton (1835&ndash;1908); the essayist Mary Abigail
Dodge, "Gail Hamilton" (1838&ndash;1896); the novelists Rose Terry
Cooke (1827&ndash;1892), Jane G. Austin (1831&ndash;1894), and Harriet
Prescott Spofford (1835&mdash;&mdash;); and, latest of all to be known, the
intense lyrist Emily Dickinson (1830&ndash;1886). In the eighties was
to come the school of the younger realists, a part of the classical
reaction&mdash;Alice Brown (1857&mdash;&mdash;), Kate Douglas Wiggin
(1859&mdash;&mdash;) and Mary E. Wilkins (1862&mdash;&mdash;), who were to
record the later phases of the New England decline.</p>

<p>Outside of the New England environment there was also a
notable outburst of feminine literature. In the thirteen years
from 1875 appeared the following significant first volumes:</p>

<p>The wide recognition of the Victorian women, Charlotte
Brontë, George Eliot, and Mrs. Browning, and their American
contemporaries, Margaret Fuller and Mrs. Stowe, had given the
impetus, and the enormous popularity of prose fiction, a literary
form peculiarly adapted to feminine treatment, the opportunity.
During all the period the work of women dominated to a large
degree the literary output.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>The earliest group to appear was made up of daughters of the
Brahmins&mdash;Louisa M. Alcott, Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, Rose
Hawthorne Lathrop, Helen Hunt Jackson, and others&mdash;transition
figures who clung to the old New England tradition, yet were
touched by the new forces. The representative figure is Elizabeth
Stuart Phelps. Daughter and granddaughter of theologians and
divinity professors, reared in the atmosphere of the Andover
theological seminary of the earlier period, she was a daughter
of her generation, a perfect sample of the culminating feminine
product of two centuries of New England Puritanism&mdash;sensitive
to the brink of physical collapse, intellectual, disquieted of soul,
ridden of conscience, introspective. We know the type perfectly.
Miss Jewett, Mrs. Freeman, Miss Brown, have drawn us scores
of these women&mdash;the final legatees of Puritanism, daughters of
Transcendentalists and abolitionists and religious wranglers.</p>

<p>Literature to this group of women was not only a heritage
from the past, from great shadowy masters who were mere names
and books, it was a home product in actual process of manufacture
about their cradles. The mother of Elizabeth Stuart Phelps&mdash;Elizabeth
Stuart&mdash;had published in 1851 <i>Sunny-Side</i>, a simple
story of life in a country parsonage, that had sold one hundred
thousand copies in one year. She had followed it with <i>A Peep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
at Number Five</i>, a book that places her with Mrs. Stowe as a
pioneer depicter of New England life, and then, at the very
opening of her career, she had died in 1852. "It was impossible
to be her daughter and not to write. Rather, I should say, impossible
to be <i>their</i> daughter and not to have something to say,
and a pen to say <span class="locked">it."<a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></span> The daughter was publishing at thirteen;
at nineteen she was the author of twelve Sunday-school
<span class="locked">books;<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></span> at twenty-four she had issued <i>The Gates Ajar</i>, which was
to go through twenty editions the first year and to be translated
into the principal European languages.</p>

<p><i>Gates Ajar</i> is a significant book, significant beyond its real
literary merit. It is a small book, an excited, over-intense book,
yet as a document in the history of a period and a confession
laying bare for an instant a woman's soul it commands attention.
It is not a novel; it is a <i>journal intime</i>, an impassioned
theological argument, a personal experience written with tears
and read with tears by hundreds of thousands. It was the writer
herself who had received the telegram telling that a loved one&mdash;not
a brother as the book infers&mdash;had been shot in battle; it was
her own life that had almost flickered out as the result of it;
and it was she who had tried to square the teachings ingrained
into her Puritan intellect with the desolation of her woman's
heart.</p>

<p>It was peculiarly a New England book: only a New Englander
of the old tradition can understand the full meaning of it, and
yet it came at a moment when the whole nation was eager and
ready for its message. The war had brought to tens of thousands
what it had brought to this New England woman. In every
house there was mourning, and the Puritan vision of the after
life, unreasonable and lifeless, was inadequate for a nation that
had been nourished upon sentimentalism. The heart of the
people demanded something warm and sensible and convincing
in place of the cold scriptural metaphors and abstractions. The
new spirit that had been awakened by the war called for reality
and concrete statement everywhere, and it found in the book,
which made of heaven another earth&mdash;a glorified New England
perhaps&mdash;with occupation and joys and friendships unchanged, a
revelation with which it was in full accord. It brought comfort,
for in every line of it was the intensity of conviction, of actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
experience. It quivered with sympathy, it breathed reality from
every page, and it seemed to break down the barriers until the
two worlds were so near together that one might hold his breath
to listen. The book, while it undoubtedly helped to prolong the
sentimental era in America, nevertheless must be counted among
the forces that brought to the new national period its fuller measure
of toleration, its demand for reality, its wider sympathy.</p>

<p>All the author's later books bear the same marks of intensity,
of subjectivity, of purpose: all of them are outpourings of herself.
She is a special pleader shrilling against abuses, as in
<i>Loveliness</i>, which excoriates vivisection, arguing for causes as in
<i>The Story of Avis</i> and <i>Doctor Zay</i>, which take high ground concerning
women, or preaching sermons as in <i>A Singular Life</i>,
a vision of the ideal pastor and his church. The accumulated
Puritanism within her gave to all her work dramatic tension.
It is impossible to read her with calmness: one is shocked and
grieved and harrowed; one is urged on every page to think, to
feel, to rush forth and right some wrong, to condemn some evil
or champion some cause.</p>

<p>Her world was largely a subjective one; to write she must
be touched strongly on the side of her sympathy, she must have
brought vividly into her vision some concrete case. Before she
could write "The Tenth of January"&mdash;<i>Atlantic</i>, 1868&mdash;she must
spend a month in the atmosphere of the tragedy, not to collect
realistic details, but to feel for herself the horror that she would
impart. Her aim was sentimental: the whole story centers about
the fact that while the ruins of the fallen mill were burning there
floated out of the flames the voices of imprisoned girls singing
"Shall We Gather at the River?" In its fundamentals her
work, all of it, is autobiographic. Womanlike, she denied the
fact&mdash;"If there be one thing among the possibilities to which a
truly civilized career is liable, more than another objectionable to
the writer of these words, the creation of autobiography has long
been that <span class="locked">one,"<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></span> and yet her books, all of them, have been chapters
out of her own spiritual life. She has felt rather than seen,
she has pleaded rather than created. Rather than present a
rounded picture of the life objectively about her, she has given
analyses of her own New England soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
She yielded, at last, in some degree, to the later tendencies of
American literature, and drew with realistic faithfulness characters
and characteristics in the little New England world that
was hers&mdash;<i>A Madonna of the Tubs</i>, <i>The Supply at St. Agatha's</i>,
<i>Jack, the Fisherman</i>, and a few others, yet even these are something
more than stories, something more than pictures and interpretations.
In <i>Jack, the Fisherman</i>, for instance, the temperance
lesson stands out as sharply as if she had taken a text.
The artist within her was dominated ever by the preacher; the
novelist by the Puritan.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Another transition figure, typical of a group of writers and
at the same time illustrative of the change that came over the
tone of American literature after the war period, is Harriet Prescott
Spofford. A country girl, born in a Maine village, educated
in the academy of a country town in New Hampshire, compelled
early to be the chief support of an invalided father and mother,
she turned from the usual employments open to the women of her
time&mdash;work in the cotton mills and school teaching&mdash;to the precarious
field of literature. That could mean only story-writing
for the family weeklies of the day, for a bourgeois public that
demanded sentimental love stories and romance. Success made
her ambitious. She applied herself to the study of fiction&mdash;American,
English, French. How wide was her reading one may
learn from her essays later published in the <i>Atlantic</i>, "The Author
of 'Charles Auchester'" and "Charles Reade." The new
realism which was beginning to be felt as a force in fiction, she
flouted with indignation:&mdash;"he never with Chinese accuracy,
gives us gossiping drivel that reduces life to the dregs of the
commonplace." Rather would she emulate the popular novelist
Elizabeth Sheppard: "At his, Disraeli's, torch she lit her fires,
over his stories she dreamed, his 'Contarini Fleming' she declared
to be the touchstone of all romantic <span class="locked">truth."<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></span> The essay reveals
the author like a flash-light. She too dreamed over Disraeli
and the early Bulwer-Lytton, over Charlotte Brontë and Poe,
over George Sand and French romance until at last when she
submitted her first story to the <i>Atlantic</i>, "In a Cellar," Lowell
for a time feared that it was a translation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
Other American women have had imaginations as lawless and
as gorgeously rich as Harriet Prescott Spofford's; Augusta J.
Evans Wilson, for instance, whose <i>St. Elmo</i> (1866) sold enormously
even to the end of the new period, but no other American
woman of the century was able to combine with her imaginings
and her riotous colorings a real distinction of style. When in
the fifth volume of the <i>Atlantic</i> appeared "The Amber Gods,"
judicious readers everywhere cried out in astonishment. Robert
Browning and others in England praised it extravagantly. A
new star had arisen, a novelist with a style that was French in
its brilliancy and condensation, and oriental in its richness and
color.</p>

<p><i>The Amber Gods</i> fails of being a masterpiece by a margin so
small that it exasperates, and it fails at precisely the point where
most of the mid-century fiction failed. In atmosphere and style
it is brilliant, so brilliant indeed that it has been appraised more
highly than it deserves. Moreover, the <i>motif</i>, as one gathers
it from the earlier pages, is worthy of a Hawthorne. The amber
beads have upon them an ancestral curse, and the heroine with
her supernatural beauty, a satanic thing without a soul, is a part
of the mystery and the curse. Love seems at length to promise
Undine-like a soul to this soulless creature:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He read it through&mdash;all that perfect, perfect scene. From the moment
when he said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">"I overlean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This length of hair and lustrous front&mdash;they turn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like an entire flower upward"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>his voice low, sustained, clear&mdash;till he reached the line,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Look at the woman here with the new soul"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>till he turned the leaf and murmured,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Shall to produce form out of unshaped stuff<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be art&mdash;and, further, to evoke a soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From form be nothing? This new soul is mine!"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>till then he never glanced up.</p></blockquote>

<p>But there is lack of constructive skill, lack of definiteness,
lack of reality. The story sprawls at the end where it should
culminate with compelling power. The last sentence is startling,
but it is not connected with the <i>motif</i> and is a mere sensational
addition. Everywhere there is the unusual, the overwrought,
incoherent vagueness. It is not experience, it is a revel of color<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
and of sensuousness; it is a Keats-like banquet, sweets and
spicery.</p>

<p>The parallelism with Keats may be pressed far. She was first
of all a poet, a lyrist, a dweller in Arcady rather than in a New
England village. She, like so many others of her generation,
had fallen under the spell of the young Tennyson, and her world
is a world of cloying sweetness, of oriental sensuousness, of
merely physical beauty. Poems like "Pomegranate-Flowers"
and "In Titian's Garden" show her tropical temperament:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And some girl sea-bronzed and sparkling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On her cheek the stain ensanguined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bears aloft the bossy salver:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the innocent Lavinia<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought them in old days of revel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fruits and flowers amesh with sunbeams&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No red burnish of pomegranates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No cleft peach in velvet vermeil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No bright grapes their blue bloom bursting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dews between the cool globes slipping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dews like drops of clouded sapphire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the brighter self and spirit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glowed illusive in her beauty.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>The same poetic glamour she threw over all the work that now
poured in swift profusion from her pen: <i>Sir Rohan's Ghost</i>,
<i>Azarian</i>, and a score of short stories in the <i>Atlantic</i> and <i>Harper's</i>
and other periodicals. It had been felt that the faults so manifest
in "In a Cellar" and "The Amber Gods" would disappear
as the young author gained in maturity and knowledge of her
art, but they not only persisted, they increased. Like Charlotte
Brontë, whom in so many ways she resembled, she knew life only
as she dreamed of it in her country seclusion or read of it in romance.
At length toleration ceased. In 1865 <i>The North American
Review</i> condemned <i>Azarian</i> as "devoid of human nature and
false to actual society," and then added the significant words:
"We would earnestly exhort Miss Prescott to be <i>real</i>, to be true
to something." It marks not alone the end of the first period
in Miss Prescott's career; it marks the closing of an era in American
fiction.</p>

<p>Wonder has often been expressed that one who could write
"The Amber Gods" and <i>Sir Rohan's Ghost</i> should suddenly lapse
into silence and refuse to work the rich vein she had opened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
The change, however, was not with the author; it was with the
times. Within a year Howells was assistant editor of the <i>Atlantic</i>.
The artificiality of style and the high literary tone demanded
in the earlier period disappeared with the war, and in
their place came simplicity and naturalness and reality. The
author of <i>Azarian</i> continued to write her passionate and melodious
romance, but the columns of the <i>Atlantic</i> and <i>Harper's</i> at
length were closed to her tales. A volume of her work of this
period still awaits a publisher.</p>

<p>She now turned to poetry&mdash;there was no ban upon that; the
old régime died first in its prose&mdash;and poured out lyrics that are
to be compared even with those of Taylor and Aldrich, lyrics full
of passion and color and sensuous beauty. Among the female
poets of America she must be accorded a place near the highest.
Only "H.&nbsp;H." could have poured out a lyric like this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the dew and the dark and the coolness<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I bend to the beaker and sip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the earth is the Lord's, and its fullness<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is held like the cup to my lip.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For his are the vast opulences<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of color, of line, and of flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his was the joy of the senses<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Before I was born to delight.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Forever the loveliness lingers,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or in flesh, or in spirit, or dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For it swept from the touch of his fingers<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While his garments trailed by in the gleam.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When the dusk and the dawn in slow union<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bring beauty to bead at the brim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I take, 't is the cup of communion,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I drink, and I drink it with Him!<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">A chapter of analysis could not so completely reveal the soul of
Harriet Prescott Spofford.</p>

<p>For a time she busied herself making books on art decoration
applied to furniture, and then at last she yielded to the forces
of the age and wrote stories that again commanded the magazines.
With work like "A Rural Telephone," "An Old Fiddler,"
and "A Village Dressmaker," she entered with real distinction
the field that had been preëmpted by Miss Cooke and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
Miss Jewett, the depiction of New England life in its actuality.
Then at the close of her literary life she wrote deeper tales, like
"Ordronnaux," a story with the same underlying <i>motif</i> as
"The Amber Gods"&mdash;the creation of a soul in soulless beauty&mdash;but
worked out now with reality, and experience, and compelling
power. But it was too late. Could she have learned her lesson
when Rose Terry Cooke learned hers; could she, instead of wasting
her powers upon the gorgeous <i>Azarian</i>, have sent forth in
1863 her volume <i>Old Madame and Other Tragedies</i>, she might
have taken a leading place among American novelists.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>The school of fiction that during the later period stands for
the depicting of New England life and character in their actuality
had as its pioneers Mrs. Stowe and Rose Terry Cooke. Both
did their earlier work in the spirit and manner of the mid century;
both were poets and dreamers; both until late in their
lives worked with feeling rather than observation and gave to
their fiction vagueness of outline and romantic unreality. <i>Uncle
Tom's Cabin</i> was written by one who had never visited the South,
who drew her materials largely from her feelings and her imagination,
and made instead of a transcript of actual life, a book
of religious emotion, a swift, unnatural succession of picturesque
scene and incident, an improvisation of lyrical passion&mdash;a melodrama.
It is the typical novel of the period before 1870, the
period that bought enormous editions of <i>The Lamplighter</i>, <i>The
Wide, Wide World</i>, and <i>St. Elmo</i>. <i>The Minister's Wooing</i>, 1859,
a historical romance written in the Andover that a little later
was to produce <i>Gates Ajar</i>, was also fundamentally religious and
controversial: it contained the keynote of what was afterwards
known as the Andover movement. It dealt with a people and
an environment that the author knew as she knew her own childhood,
and it had therefore, as <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> has not, sympathy
of comprehension and truth to local scene and character.
And yet despite her knowledge and her sympathy, the shadow of
the mid century lies over it from end to end. It lacked what
<i>Elsie Venner</i> lacked, what the great bulk of the pre-Civil War
literature lacked, organization, sharpness of line, reality. Lowell,
a generation ahead of his time, saw the weakness as well as the
strength of the book, and in pointing it out he criticized not alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
the author but her period as well. "My advice," he wrote her
with fine courage, "is to follow your own instincts&mdash;to stick to
nature, and avoid what people commonly call the 'Ideal'; for
that, and beauty, and pathos, and success, all lie in the simply
natural.... There are ten thousand people who can write
'ideal' things for one who can see, and feel, and reproduce nature
and <span class="locked">character."<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></span> Again the voice of the new period in
American literature. But Mrs. Stowe was not one to heed literary
advice; her work must come by inspiration, by impulse
connected with purpose, and it must work itself out without
thought of laws or models. <i>The Pearl of Orr's Island</i> came by
impulse, as later, in 1869, came <i>Oldtown Folks</i>. "It was more
to me than a story," she wrote of it; "it is my résumé of the
whole spirit and body of New England, a country that is now
exerting such an influence on the civilized world that to know it
truly becomes an <span class="locked">object."<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></span> That these books, and the <i>Oldtown
Fireside Stories</i> that followed, do furnish such a résumé is by no
means true, but that they are faithful transcripts of New England
life, and are pioneer books in a field that later was to be
intensively cultivated, cannot be doubted.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stowe's influence upon later writers was greater than is
warranted by her actual accomplishment. The fierce light that
beat upon <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> gave to all of her work extraordinary
publicity and made of her a model when otherwise she
would have been unknown. The real pioneer was Rose Terry
Cooke, daughter of a humble family in a small Connecticut village.
Educated in a seminary near her home, at sixteen she was
teaching school and at eighteen she was writing for <i>Graham's
Magazine</i> a novel called <i>The Mormon's Wife</i>. That she had
never been in Utah and had never even seen a Mormon, mattered
not at all; the tale to win its audience need be true only to its
author's riotous fancy. But the author had humor as well as
fancy, and her sense of humor was to save her. In her school
work in rural districts she was in contact constantly with the
quaint and the ludicrous, with all those strongly individualized
characters that Puritanism and isolated country living had rendered
abundant. They were a part of her every-day life; they
appealed not only to her sense of humor, but to her sympathy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
She found herself thinking of them as she sought for subjects for
her fiction. Her passion and her ambition were centered upon
poetry. The idealism and the loftiness that Harriet Prescott
Spofford threw into her early romance, she threw into her lyrics.
Fiction was a thing of less seriousness; it could be trifled with;
it could even record the humor and the quaintness of the common
folk amid whom she toiled. She turned to it as to a diversion
and she was surprised to find that Lowell, the editor of the new
and exclusive <i>Atlantic</i>, preferred it to her poetry. For the first
volume of the magazine he accepted no fewer than five of her
homely little sketches, and praised them for their fidelity and truth.</p>

<p>That the author considered this prose work an innovation and
something below the high tone of real literature, cannot be
doubted. In "Miss Lucinda" (<i>Atlantic</i>, 1861), as perfect a
story of its kind as was ever written, she feels called upon to
explain, and her explanation is a declaration of independence:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>But if I apologize for a story that is nowise tragic, nor fitted to "the
fashion of these times," possibly somebody will say at its end that I
should also have apologized for its subject, since it is as easy for an
author to treat his readers to high themes as vulgar ones, and velvet
can be thrown into a portrait as cheaply as calico; but of this apology
I wash my hands. I believe nothing in place or circumstance makes
romance. I have the same quick sympathy for Biddy's sorrows with
Patrick that I have for the Empress of France and her august, but
rather grim, lord and master. I think words are often no harder to
bear than "a blue batting," and I have a reverence for poor old maids
as great as for the nine Muses. Commonplace people are only commonplace
from character, and no position affects that. So forgive me
once more, patient reader, if I offer you no tragedy in high life, no
sentimental history of fashion and wealth, but only a little story about
a woman who could not be a heroine.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is the key to her later work. She wrote simple little
stories of commonplace people in a commonplace environment,
and she treated them with the sympathy of one who shares, rather
than as one who looks down upon a spectacle and takes sides.
There is no bookish flavor about the stories: they are as artless
as the narrative told by a winter hearth. In the great mass of
fiction dealing with New England life and character her work
excels in humor&mdash;that subdued humor which permeates every
part like an atmosphere&mdash;in the picturing of the odd and the
whimsical, in tenderness and sympathy, and in the perfect artlessness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
that is the last triumph of art. Hers is not a realism of
the severe and scientific type: it is a poetic realism like that of
the earlier and more delightful Howells, a realism that sees life
through a window with the afternoon light upon it. In the whole
output of the school there are few sketches more charming and
more true than her "Miss Lucinda," "Freedom Wheeler's Controversy
with Providence," "Old Miss Dodd," "The Deacon's
Week," and "A Town and a Country Mouse." Others, like
Mrs. Slosson and Rowland E. Robinson, for instance, have caught
with exquisite skill the grotesque and the humorous side of
New England life, but none other has shown the whole of New
England with the sympathy and the comprehension and the delicacy
of Rose Terry Cooke.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Of the later group, the generation born in the fifties and the
early sixties, Sarah Orne Jewett is the earliest figure. With her
there was no preliminary dallying with mid-century sentiment
and sensationalism; she belongs to the era of <i>Oldtown Folks</i>
rather than of <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>. "It was happily in the
writer's childhood," she records in her later introduction to
<i>Deephaven</i>, "that Mrs. Stowe had written of those who dwelt
along the wooded sea-coast and by the decaying, shipless harbors
of Maine. The first chapters of <i>The Pearl of Orr's Island</i> gave
the young author of <i>Deephaven</i> to see with new eyes and to
follow eagerly the old shore paths from one gray, weather-beaten
house to another, where Genius pointed her the way."
And again in a letter written in 1889: "I have been reading the
beginning of <i>The Pearl of Orr's Island</i> and finding it just as
clear and perfectly original and strong as it seemed to me in my
thirteenth or fourteenth year, when I read it first. I shall never
forget the exquisite flavor and reality of delight it gave me. It is
classical&mdash;historical."<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>She herself had been born by one of those same "decaying,
shipless harbors of Maine," at South Berwick, a village not far
from the native Portsmouth of Thomas Bailey Aldrich. It was
no ordinary town, this deserted little port. "A stupid, common
country town, some one dared to call Deephaven in a letter once,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
and how bitterly we resented <span class="locked">it."<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></span> It had seen better days.
There was an atmosphere about it from a romantic past. In
Miss Jewett's work it figures as Deephaven. "The place prided
itself most upon having been long ago the residence of one Governor
Chantrey, who was a rich ship-owner and East India merchant,
and whose fame and magnificence were almost fabulous....
There were formerly five families who kept their coaches in
Deephaven; there were balls at the Governor's and regal entertainments
at other of the grand mansions; there is not a really
distinguished person in the country who will not prove to have
been directly or indirectly connected with Deephaven." And
again, "Deephaven seemed more like one of the cozy little English
seaside towns than any other. It was not in the least American."</p>

<p>The social régime of this early Berwick had been cavalier rather
than Puritan. It had survived in a few old families like the
Jewetts, a bit of the eighteenth century come down into the late
nineteenth. Miss Jewett all her life seemed like her own Miss
Chauncey, an exotic from an earlier day, a survival&mdash;"thoroughly
at her ease, she had the manner of a lady of the olden
time." Her father, a courtly man and cultivated, a graduate of
Bowdoin and for a time a lecturer there, gave ever the impression
that he could have filled with brilliancy a larger domain than that
he had deigned to occupy. He had settled down in Berwick as
physician for a wide area, much trusted and much revered, a
physician who ministered to far more than the physical needs of
his people. His daughter, with a daughter's loving hand, has
depicted him in <i>A Country Doctor</i>, perhaps the most tender and
intimate of all her studies. She owed much to him; from him had
come, indeed, the greater part of all that was vital in her education.
Day after day she had ridden with him along the country
roads, and had called with him at the farmhouses and cottages,
and had talked with him of people and flowers and birds, of olden
times, of art and literature.</p>

<p>A story from her pen, "Mr. Bruce," signed "A.&nbsp;E. Eliot," had
appeared in the <i>Atlantic</i> as early as 1869, but it was not until
1873 that "The Shore House," changed later to "Kate Lancaster's
Plan," the first of the <i>Deephaven</i> papers, appeared in
the same magazine. She had begun to write with a definite purpose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
"When I was perhaps fifteen," she records in an autobiographical
fragment, "the first city boarders began to make
their appearance near Berwick, and the way they misconstrued
the country people and made game of their peculiarities fired me
with indignation. I determined to teach the world that country
people were not the awkward, ignorant set those people seemed to
think. I wanted the world to know their grand simple lives;
and, so far as I had a mission, when I first began to write, I think
that was it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Stowe and Mrs. Cooke were the depicters of the older
New England, the New England at flood tide; Miss Jewett was
the first to paint the ebb. With them New England was a social
unit as stable as the England of Jane Austen; with her it was a
society in transition, the passing of an old régime. The westward
exodus had begun, with its new elements of old people left
behind by their migrating children, the deserted farm, the decaying
seaside town, the pathetic return of the native for a brief
day, as in "A Native of Winby," and, to crown it all, the summer
boarder who had come in numbers to laugh at the old and
wonder at it. She would preserve all that was finest in the New
England that was passing, and put it into clear light that all
might see how glorious the past had been, and how beautiful and
true were the pathetic fragments that still remained.</p>

<p>She approached her work with the serenity and the seriousness
of one who goes to devotions. She was never watchful for the
eccentric and the picturesque; there are no grotesque deacons and
shrill old maids in her stories. She would depict only the finer
and gentler side of New England life: men quiet and kindly;
women sweet-tempered and serene. We may smile over her pictures
of ancient mariners "sunning themselves like turtles on the
wharves," her weather-beaten farmers gentle as women, and her
spinsters and matrons, like Miss Debby, belonging to "a class of
elderly New England women which is fast dying out," but we
leave them always with the feeling that they are noblemen and
ladies in disguise. Her little stretch of Maine coast with its
pointed firs, its bleak farms, and its little villages redolent of
the sea she has made peculiarly her own domain, just as Hardy
has made Wessex his, and she has made of her native Deephaven
an American counterpart of Cranford.</p>

<p>Many times Miss Jewett has been compared with Hawthorne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
and undoubtedly there is basis for comparison. Her style, indeed,
in its simplicity and effortless strength may be likened
to his, and her pictures of decaying wharves and of quaint personages
in an old town by the sea have the same atmosphere and
the same patrician air of distinction, but further one may not
go. Of his power to trace the blighting and transforming effects
of a sin and his wizard knowledge of the human heart, she had
nothing. She is a writer of little books and short stories, the
painter of a few subjects in a provincial little area, but within
her narrow province she has no rival nearer her own times than
Mrs. Gaskell.</p>

<p>Her kinship is with Howells rather than with Hawthorne, the
Howells of the earlier manner, with his pictures of the Boston
of the East India days, his half-poetic studies in background and
character, his portraits etched with exquisite art, his lambent
humor that plays over all like an evening glow. In her stories,
too, the plot is slight, and background and characterization and
atmosphere dominate; and as with him in the days before the
poet had been put to death, realism is touched everywhere with
romance. She paints the present ever upon the background of
an old, forgotten, far-off past, with that dim light upon it that
now lies over the South of the old plantation days. Over all of
her work lies this gentle glamour, this softness of atmosphere, this
evanescent shade of regret for something vanished forever. Hers
is a transfigured New England, a New England with all its roughness
and coarseness and sordidness refined away, the New England
undoubtedly that her gentle eyes actually saw. Once, indeed,
she wrote pure romance. Her <i>The Tory Lover</i> is her dream
of New England's day of chivalry, the high tide mark from which
to measure the depth of its ebb.</p>

<p>Her power lies in her purity of style, her humorous little
touches, and her power of characterization. Work like her "A
White Heron," "Miss Tempy's Watchers," and "The Dulham
Ladies," has a certain lightness of touch, a pathos and a humor,
a skill in delineation which wastes not a word or an effect, that
places it among the most delicate and finished of American short
stories. Yet brilliant as they are in technique, in characterization
and background and atmosphere, they lack nevertheless the
final touch of art. They are <i>too</i> literary; they are too much
works of art, too much from the intellect and not enough from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
the heart. They are Sir Roger de Coverley sketches, marvelously
well done, but always from the Sir Roger standpoint. There is
a certain "quality" in all that Miss Jewett wrote, a certain
unconscious <i>noblesse oblige</i> that kept her ever in the realm of the
gentle, the genteel, the Berwick old régime. One feels it in her
avoidance of everything common and squalid, in her freedom
from passion and dramatic climax, in her objective attitude toward
her characters. She is always sympathetic, she is moved
at times to real pathos, but she stands apart from her picture;
she observes and describes; she never, like Rose Terry Cooke,
mingles and shares. She cannot. Hers is the pride that the
lady of the estate takes in her beloved peasantry; of the patrician
who steps down of an afternoon into the cottage and comes back
to tell with amusement and perhaps with tears of what she finds
there.</p>

<p>All her life she lived apart from that which she described.
Her winters she spent in Boston, much of the time in the home
of Mrs. James T. Fields, surrounded by memorials of the great
period of American literature. Like Howells, she wrote ever in
the presence of the Brahmins&mdash;a task not difficult, for she herself
was a Brahmin. It was impossible for her to be common
or to be narrowly realistic. She wrote with deliberation and she
revised and rerevised and finished her work, conscious ever of her
art&mdash;a classicist, sending forth nothing that came as a cry
from her heart, nothing that came winged with a message,
nothing that voiced a vision and a new seeing, nothing that
was not literary in the highest classical sense. In the history of
the new period she stands midway between Mrs. Spofford and Mrs.
Freeman; a new realist whose heart was with the old school; a
romanticist, but equipped with a camera and a fountain pen.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Mary E. Wilkins Freeman is the typical representative of the
group born a generation after the women of the thirties, the
group that knew nothing of the emotional fifties and sixties, and
that began its work when the new literature of actuality, the
realism of Flaubert and Hardy and Howells, was in full domination.
Of hesitancy, of transition from the old to the new, her
fiction shows no trace. From her first story she was a realist, as
enamoured of actuality and as restrained as Maupassant. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
seems to have followed no one: realism was a thing native to her,
as indeed it is native to all women. "Women are delicate and
patient observers," Henry James has said in his essay on Trollope.
"They hold their noses close, as it were, to the texture of
life. They feel and perceive the real." But to her realism Miss
Wilkins added a power usually denied her sex, the power of detachment,
the epic power that excludes the subjective and hides
the artist behind the picture. In all the writings of the creator
of <i>Gates Ajar</i> we see but the intense and emotional soul of Elizabeth
Stuart Phelps; in that of the writer of <i>A Humble Romance</i>
we see only the grim lineaments of New England, a picture as
remorseless and as startling as if a searchlight had been turned
into the dim and cobwebbed recesses of an ancient vault. She
stands not aloof like Miss Jewett; she is simply unseen. She is
working in the materials of her own heart and drawing the outlines
of her own home, yet she possesses the epic power to keep
her creations impersonal to the point of anonymousness.</p>

<p>For her work, everything in her life was a preparation. She
was born in Randolph not far from Boston, of an ancestry which
extended back into the darkest shadows of Puritanism, to old
Salem and a judge in the witchcraft trials. Her more immediate
progenitors were of humble station: her father was first a builder
in her native Randolph, then a store-keeper in Brattleboro,
Vermont. Thus her formative years were passed in the narrow
environment of New England villages. The death of her father
and mother during her early girlhood must also be recorded, as
should the fact that her schooling was austere and limited.</p>

<p>When she approached literature, therefore, it was as a daughter
of the Puritans, as one who had been nurtured in repression. Love
in its tropical intensity, the fierce play of the passions, color, profusion,
outspoken toleration, freedom&mdash;romance in its broadest
connotation&mdash;of these she knew nothing. She had lived her whole
life in the warping atmosphere of inherited Puritanism, of a Puritanism
that had lost its earlier vitality and had become a convention
and a superstition, in a social group inbred for generations
and narrowly restricted to neighborhood limits. "They were all
narrow-lived country people," she writes. "Their customs had
made deeper grooves in their roads; they were more fastidious and
jealous of their social rights than many in higher <span class="locked">positions."<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
"Everything out of the broad, common track was a horror to
these men, and to many of their village fellows. Strange shadows
that their eyes could not pierce, lay upon such, and they were
<span class="locked">suspicious."<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></span> "She was a New England woman, and she discussed
all topics except purely material ones shamefacedly with
her <span class="locked">sister."<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>In the mid eighties when she began her work the primitive
Puritan element had vanished from all but the more remote and
sheltered nooks of New England. The toll of the war, the Western
rush, and the call of the cities had left behind the old and
the conservative and the helpless, the last distorted relics of a
distorting old régime. To her these were the true New England:
she would write the last act of the grim drama that had begun
at Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay. She recorded it very
largely in her first four volumes: <i>A Humble Romance</i>, twenty-four
short stories as grim and austere as Puritanism itself; <i>A
New England Nun and Other Stories</i>; <i>Jane Field</i>, a prolonged
short story; and <i>Pembroke, a Novel</i>. This is the vital part of
her work, the part that is to bear up and preserve her name if it
is to endure.</p>

<p>The key to this earlier work is the word <i>repression</i>. The very
style is puritanic; it is angular, unornamented, severe; it is
rheumatic like the greater part of the characters it deals with;
it gasps in short sentences and hobbles disconnectedly. It deals
ever with repressed lives: with dwarfed and anemic old maids
who have been exhorted all their lives to self-examination and to
the repression of every emotion and instinct; with women unbalanced
and neurotic, who subside at last into dumb endurance;
with slaves of a parochial public opinion and of conventions
ridiculously narrow hardened into iron laws; with lives in which
the Puritan inflexibility and unquestioning obedience to duty has
been inherited as stubbornness and balky setness, as in Deborah
and Barnabas Thayer who in earlier ages would have figured as
martyrs or pilgrims.</p>

<p>Her unit of measure is short. It is not hers to trace the slow
development of a soul through a long period; it is hers to deal
with climactic episodes, with the one moment in a repressed life
when the repression gives way and the long pent-up forces sweep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
all before them, as in "The Revolt of Mother," or "A Village
Singer." Her effects she accomplishes with the fewest strokes
possible. Like the true New Englander that she is, she will
waste not a word. In her story "Life-Everlasting," Luella&mdash;the
author's miserliness with words withholds her other name&mdash;has
gone to carry a pillow to the farmhouse of Oliver Weed. She
wonders at the closed and deserted appearance of the premises.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Luella heard the cows low in the barn as she opened the kitchen
door. "Where&mdash;did all that&mdash;blood come from?" said she.</p>

<p>She began to breathe in quick gasps; she stood clutching her pillow,
and looking. Then she called: "Mr. Weed! Mr. Weed! Where be
you? Mis' Weed! Is anything the matter? Mis' Weed!" The silence
seemed to beat against her ears. She went across the kitchen to
the bedroom. Here and there she held back her dress. She reached
the bedroom door, and looked in.</p>

<p>Luella pressed back across the kitchen into the yard. She went out
into the yard and turned towards the village. She still carried the life-everlasting
pillow, but she carried it as if her arms and that were all
stone. She met a woman whom she knew, and the woman spoke; but
Luella did not notice her; she kept on. The woman stopped and looked
after her.</p>

<p>Luella went to the house where the sheriff lived, and knocked. The
sheriff himself opened the door. He was a large, pleasant man. He
began saying something facetious about her being out calling early, but
Luella stopped him.</p>

<p>"You'd&mdash;better go up to the&mdash;Weed house," said she, in a dry voice.
"There's some&mdash;trouble."</p></blockquote>

<p>That is all we are told as to what Luella saw, though it comes
out later that the man and his wife had been murdered by the
hired man&mdash;how we know not. There is a primitiveness about
the style, its gasping shortness of sentence, its repetitions like the
story told by a child, its freedom from all straining for effect,
its bareness and grimness, that stamps it as a genuine human
document; not art but life itself.</p>

<p>For external nature she cares little. Her backgrounds are
meager; the human element alone interests her. There is no
Mary E. Wilkins country as there is a Sarah Orne Jewett country;
there are only Mary E. Wilkins people. A somber group
they are&mdash;exceptions, perhaps, grim survivals, distortions, yet
absolutely true to one narrow phase of New England life. Her
realism as she depicts these people is as inexorable as Balzac's.
"A Village Lear" would have satisfied even Maupassant. Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
one jot is bated from the full horror of the picture; it is driven
to its pitiless end without a moment of softening. No detail is
omitted. It is <i>Père Goriot</i> reduced to a chapter. A picture like
this from "Louisa" grips one by its very pitilessness:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There was nothing for supper but some bread and butter and weak
tea, though the old man had his dish of Indian-meal porridge. He
could not eat much solid food. The porridge was covered with milk
and molasses. He bent low over it, and ate large spoonfuls with loud
noises. His daughter had tied a towel around his neck as she would
have tied a pinafore on a child. She had also spread a towel over the
tablecloth in front of him, and she watched him sharply lest he should
spill his food.</p>

<p>"I wish I could have somethin' to eat that I could relish the way he
does that porridge and molasses," said she [the mother]. She had
scarcely tasted anything. She sipped her weak tea laboriously.</p>

<p>Louisa looked across at her mother's meager little figure in its neat
old dress, at her poor small head bending over the teacup, showing the
wide parting in the thin hair.</p>

<p>"Why don't you toast your bread, mother?" said she. "I'll toast it
for you."</p>

<p>"No, I don't want it. I'd jest as soon have it this way as any. I
don't want no bread, nohow. I want somethin' to relish&mdash;a herrin', or
a little mite of cold meat, or somethin'. I s'pose I could eat as well
as anybody if I had as much as some folks have. Mis' Mitchell was
sayin' the other day that she didn't believe but what they had butcher's
meat up to Mis' Nye's every day in the week. She said Jonathan he
went to Wolfsborough and brought home great pieces in a market-basket
every week."</p></blockquote>

<p>She is strong only in short efforts. She has small power of
construction: even <i>Pembroke</i> may be resolved into a series of
short stories. The setness of Barnabas Thayer is prolonged until
it ceases to be convincing: we lose sympathy; he becomes a mere
Ben Jonson "humor" and not a human being. The story is
strong only in its episodes&mdash;the cherry party of the tight-fisted
Silas Berry, the midnight coasting of the boy Ephraim, the removal
of Hannah to the poorhouse, the marriage of Rebecca&mdash;but
these touch the very heart of New England. Because of their
artlessness they are the perfection of art.</p>

<p>In her later period Miss Wilkins became sophisticated and self-conscious.
The acclaim of praise that greeted her short stories
tempted her to essay a larger canvas in wider fields of art. She
had awakened to a realization of the bareness of her style and she
sought to bring to her work ornament and the literary graces.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
She experimented with verse and drama and juveniles, with long
novels and romances, and even with tales of New Jersey life. In
vain. Her decline began with <i>Madelon</i>, which is improbable and
melodramatic, and it continued through all her later work. She
wrote problem novels like <i>The Portion of Labor</i>, long and sprawling
and ineffective, and stories like <i>By the Light of the Soul</i>, as
impossible and as untrue to life as a young country girl's dream
of city society. As a novelist and as a depicter of life outside of
her narrow domain, she has small equipment. She stands for
but one thing: short stories of the grim and bare New England
social system; sketches austere and artless which limn the very
soul of a passing old régime; photographs which are more than
photographs: which are threnodies.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The last phase of the school may be studied in the work of
Alice Brown, representative of the influences at the end of the
century. The late recognition of her fiction&mdash;she was born in
1857&mdash;which placed her a decade after Miss Wilkins who was
born in 1862, compelled her to serve an apprenticeship like that of
Howells, and subjected her work to the new shaping influences of
the nineties. When she did gain recognition in 1895, she brought
a finished art. She had mastered the newly worked-out science
of the short story, she had studied the English masters&mdash;chiefest
of all Stevenson, whose influence so dominated the closing century.</p>

<p>She was not a realist as Miss Wilkins was a realist. The New
England dialect stories of <i>Meadow Grass</i> were not put forth to
indicate the final field that she had chosen for her art: they were
experiments just as all the others of her earlier efforts were experiments.
Of her first seven books, <i>Fools of Nature</i>, with its
background of spiritualism, was a serious attempt at serious
fiction with a thesis worthy of a George Eliot, <i>Mercy Warren</i> and
<i>Robert Louis Stevenson</i> were biographical and critical studies,
<i>By Oak and Thorn</i> was a collection of travel essays, <i>The Road to
Castelay</i> was a collection of poems, and <i>The Day of His Youth</i>
perhaps a romance.</p>

<p>That she won her recognition as a writer of dialect tales rather
than as a novelist, a poet, an essayist, a romancer, was due, first,
to the nature of the times, and, secondly, to the fact that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
tales were a section of her own life written with fullness of
knowledge and sympathy. She had been born and reared in a
New Hampshire town, educated in a country school and a rural
"female seminary," and, like Rose Terry Cooke, she had taught
school. Later she had broken from this early area of her life
and had resided in Boston. The glamour of childhood grew
more and more golden over the life she had left behind her; the
memories of fragrant summer evenings in the green country and
of the old homes she had known with all their varied inmates
grew ever more tender on her pages as she wrote. It was impossible
for her not to be true to this area that she knew so completely.
Characters like Mrs. Blair and Miss Dyer in "Joint
Owners in Spain," or Farmer Eli in "Farmer Eli's Vacation"
stood living before her imagination as she told of them. She had
known them in the flesh. If she were to paint the picture at all
she must paint it as it was in her heart. To add to it or to subtract
from it were to violate truth itself.</p>

<p>Her stories differ from Mrs. Cooke's and Miss Jewett's in a
certain quality of atmosphere&mdash;it is difficult to explain more
accurately. They have a quality of humor and of pathos, a
sprightliness and freedom about them that are all their own.
They never fall into carelessness like so much of the work of Mrs.
Stowe and they are never poorly constructed. They are photographically
true to the life they represent, and yet they possess,
many of them, the beauties and the graces and the feeling of
romance. They add richness to realism. In style she is the
antithesis of Miss Wilkins. There is beauty in all of her prose,
a half-felt tripping of feet often, a lilting rhythm as unpremeditated
as a bird-song, swift turns of expression that are near
to poetry. An inscription in the Tiverton churchyard halts her,
and as she muses upon it she is wholly a poet:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The purple flower of a maid"! All the blossomy sweetness, the
fragrant lament of Lycidas, lies in that one line. Alas, poor love-lies-bleeding!
And yet not poor according to the barren pity we accord
the dead, but dowered with another youth set like a crown upon
the unstained front of this. Not going with sparse blossoms ripened
or decayed, but heaped with buds and dripping over in perfume. She
seems so sweet in her still loveliness, the empty province of her balmy
spring, that, for a moment fain are you to snatch her back into the
pageant of your day. Reading that phrase, you feel the earth is poorer
for her loss. And yet, not so, since the world holds other greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
worlds as well. Elsewhere she may have grown to age and stature, but
here she lives yet in beauteous permanence&mdash;as true a part of youth
and joy and rapture as the immortal figures on the Grecian urn. While
she was but a flying phantom on the frieze of time, Death fixed her
there forever&mdash;a haunting spirit in perennial bliss.</p></blockquote>

<p>Whenever she touches nature she touches it as a poet. She
was of the mid nineties which saw the triumph of the nature
school. Behind each of her stories lies a rich background of
mountain or woodland or meadow, one that often, as in "A Sea
Change," dominates in Thomas Hardy fashion the whole picture.</p>

<p>Only a comparatively few of Miss Brown's volumes deal with
the field with which her name is chiefly associated. <i>Meadow
Grass</i>, <i>Tiverton Tales</i>, and <i>The Country Road</i> contain the best
of her dialect stories. Her heart in later years has been altogether
in other work. She has written novels not provincial in
their setting, and, unlike Miss Wilkins, she has succeeded in
doing really distinctive work. She has the constructive power
that is denied so many, especially women, who have succeeded
with the short story. She has done dramatic work which has
won high rewards and she has written poetry. Perhaps she is a
poet first of all.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE NEW ROMANCE</span></h2>

<p>The novelists who began their work in the seventies found
themselves in a dilemma. On one side was the new school which
was becoming more and more insistent that literature in America
must be a thing American, colored by American soil, and vivid
and vital with the new spirit of Ibsen, Tolstoy, Hardy, Maupassant,
Howells, that was thrilling everywhere like the voice of a
coming era. But on the other hand there was the firmly set tradition
that the new world was barren of literary material, that
it lay spick and span with no romantic backgrounds save perhaps
the Dutch Hudson and old Puritan Salem and colonial Boston.
As late as 1872 the <i>North American Review</i> declared that
the true writer of fiction "must idealize. The idealizing novelists
will be the real novelists. All truth does not lie in <span class="locked">facts."<a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></span>
And it further declared that he must look away from his own
land, where there is no shadow and no antiquity, into the uncharted
fields of the imagination. "One would say that the
natural tendency of the American novelist would be toward
romance; that the very uniformity of our social life would offer
nothing tempting to the writer, unless indeed to the <span class="locked">satirist."<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the voice of the school that had ruled the mid century,
a school that was still alive and was still a dominating force of
which young writers were tremendously conscious. The reading
public was not prepared for the new realism: it had been nurtured
on <i>The Token</i> and <i>The Talisman</i>. The new must come
not as a revolution, swift and sudden; but as an evolution, slow
and imperceptible. During the seventies even Howells and
James were romancers; romancers, however, in process of change.</p>

<p>For the seventies in the history of American fiction was a
period of compromise and transition. The new school would
be romantic and yet at the same time it would be realistic. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
way opened unexpectedly. The widening of the American horizon,
the sudden vogue of the Pike literature, the new exploiting
of the continent in all its wild nooks and isolated neighborhoods&mdash;strange
areas as unknown to the East as the California mines
and the canebrakes of the great river&mdash;and above all the emergence
of the South, brought with it another discovery: Hawthorne
and the mid-century school had declared romance with
American background impossible simply because in their provincial
narrowness they had supposed that America was bounded
on the south and west by the Atlantic and the Hudson. America
was discovered to be full of romantic material. It had a past
not connected at all with the Knickerbockers or even the Pilgrims.
Behind whole vast areas of it lay the shadow of old
forgotten régimes, "picturesque and gloomy wrongs," with ruins
and mystery and vague tradition.</p>

<p>One of the earliest results, then, of the new realism, strangely
enough, was a new romanticism, new American provinces added
to the bounds of Arcady. The first gold of it, appropriately
enough, came from California, where Harte and Mrs. Jackson
caught glimpses of an old Spanish civilization alive only in
the picturesque ruins of its Missions. Quickly it was found
again, rich and abundant, in New Orleans, where Spain and then
France had held dominion in a vague past; then in the plantations
of the old South where Page and others caught the last
glories of that fading cavalier civilization which had been prolonged
through a century of twilight by the archaic institution
of slavery; and then even in the spick-and-span new central
West with its traditions of a chivalrous old French régime.</p>

<p>America, indeed, was full of romantic area, full of a truly
romantic atmosphere, for it had been for centuries the battle-field
of races, the North&mdash;England, New England, Anglo-Saxons&mdash;against
the South&mdash;Spain, France, the slave-holding Cavaliers.
And romance in all lands is the record of the old crushed out
by the new, the dim tradition of a struggle between North and
South: the South with its tropic imagination, its passion, its
beauty, its imperious pride, its barbaric background; the North
with its logic, its discipline, its perseverance, its passionless force.
Romance has ever held as its theme the passing of an old Southern
régime before the barbarians of the North. And romance
in America has centered always in the South. Realism might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
flourish in Boston and the colder classical atmospheres, but not
along the gulf and the tropic rivers. The reading public, however,
and the great publishing houses were in the North. The
result was compromise: the new romanticism, Southern in its
atmosphere and spirit, Northern in its truth to life and conditions.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Harte in <i>Gabriel Conroy</i> glimpsed the new fields of romance;
George Washington Cable (1844&mdash;&mdash;), the earliest of the new
Southern school, was the first fully to enter them. His gateway
was old New Orleans, most romantic of Southern cities, unknown
to Northern readers until his pen revealed it. It seemed hardly
possible that the new world possessed such a Bagdad of wonder:
old Spanish aristocracy, French chivalry of a forgotten <i>ancien
régime</i>, creoles, Acadians from the Grand Pré dispersion, adventurers
from all the picturesque ports of the earth, slavery
with its barbaric atmosphere and its shuddery background of
dread, and behind it all and around it all like a mighty moat
shutting it close in upon itself and rendering all else in the world
a mere hearsay and dream, the swamps and lagoons of the great
river.</p>

<p>Cable was a native of the old city. During a happy boyhood
he played and rambled over the whole of it and learned
to know it as only a boy can know the surroundings of his home.
His boyhood ended when he was fourteen with the death of his
father and the responsibility that devolved upon him to help
support his mother and her little family left with scanty means.
There was to be no more schooling. He marked boxes in the custom
house until the war broke out, and then at seventeen he
enlisted in the Confederate army and served to the end. Returning
to New Orleans, he found employment in a newspaper
office, where he proved a failure; he studied surveying until he
was forced by malarial fever caught in the swamps to abandon
it; then, after a slow recovery, he entered the employ of a firm
of cotton factors and for years served them as an accountant.
It was an unpromising beginning. At thirty-five he was still
recording transfers of cotton, and weights and prices and commissions.</p>

<p>But his heart, like Charles Lamb's, was in volumes far different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
from those upon his office desk. He had always been a
studious youth. He had read much: Dickens, Thackeray, Poe,
Irving, Scott; and, like a true native of the old city to whom
French was a mother tongue, Hugo, Mérimée, About. He loved
also to pore over antiquarian records: <i>Relations</i> of the priest
explorers, and old French documents and writings. His first
impulse to write came to him as he sat amid these dusty records.
"It would give me pleasure," he once wrote in a letter, "to tell
you how I came to drop into the writing of romances, but I cannot;
I just dropt. Money, fame, didactic or controversial impulse
I scarcely felt a throb of. I just wanted to do it because
it seemed a pity for the stuff to go so to waste."</p>

<p>Cable's first story, "'Sieur George," appeared in <i>Scribner's
Monthly</i> in October, 1873. Edward King, touring the Southern
States in 1872 for his series of papers entitled <i>The Great South</i>,
had found the young accountant pottering away at his local history
and his studies of local conditions and had secured some of his
work for Dr. Holland. During the next three years five other
articles were published in the magazine and one, "Posson Jone,"
in <i>Appleton's</i>, but they caused no sensation. It was not until
1879, when the seven stories were issued in book form as <i>Old
Creole Days</i>, that recognition came. The long delay was good
for Cable: it compelled him, in Hawthorne fashion, to brood
over his early work in his rare intervals of leisure, to contemplate
each piece a long time, and to finish it and enrich it. He put
forth no immaturities; he began to publish at the point where his
art was perfect.</p>

<p>The reception accorded to <i>Old Creole Days</i> was like that accorded
to Harte's <i>Luck of Roaring Camp</i>. It took its place at
once as a classic, and the verdict has never been questioned.
There is about the book, and the two books which quickly followed
it, an exotic quality, an <i>aura</i> of strangeness, that is like
nothing else in our literature. They seem not American at all;
surely such a background and such an atmosphere as that never
could have existed "within the bounds of our stalwart republic."
They are romance, one feels; pure creations of fancy, prolongations
of the Longfellowism of the mid century&mdash;and yet, as one
reads on and on, the conviction grows that they are not romance;
they are really true. Surely "Posson Jone" and "Madame Delphine"
are not creations of fancy. The elided and softly lisping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
dialect, broken-down French rather than debased English, is not
an invention of the author's: it carries conviction the more one
studies it; it is not brought in to show: it adds at every point to
the reality of the work. And the carefully worked-in backgrounds&mdash;let
Lafcadio Hearn speak, who settled in the city a few
months after "Jean-ah Poquelin" came out in <i>Scribner's
Monthly</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The strict perfection of his Creole architecture is readily recognized
by all who have resided in New Orleans. Each one of those charming
pictures of places&mdash;veritable pastels&mdash;was painted after some carefully
selected model of French or Franco-Spanish origin&mdash;typifying fashions
of building which prevailed in the colonial days.... The author of
<i>Madame Delphine</i> must have made many a pilgrimage into the quaint
district, to study the wrinkled faces of the houses, or perhaps to read
the queer names upon the signs&mdash;as Balzac loved to do in old-fashioned
<span class="locked">Paris.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>It is realism, and yet how far removed from Zola and Flaubert&mdash;Flaubert
with his "sentiment is the devil"! It is realism
tempered with romance; it is the new romance of the transition.
There is seemingly no art about it, no striving for effect, and
there is no exhibition of quaint and unusual things just because
they <i>are</i> quaint and unusual. Rather are we transported into
a charmed atmosphere, "the tepid, orange-scented air of the
South," with the soft Creole <i>patois</i> about us and romance become
real. The very style is Creole&mdash;Creole as Cable knew the Creoles
of the quadroon type. There is a childish simplicity about
it, and there is a lightness, an epigrammatic finesse, an elision of
all that can be suggested, that is Gallic and not Saxon at all.</p>

<p>One can feel this exotic quality most fully in the portraits of
women: 'Tite Poulette, Madame Delphine, Aurora Nancanou,
Clotilde, and the others, portraits etched in with infinitesimal
lightness of touch, suggested rather than described, felt rather
than seen. These are not Northern women, these daintily feminine
survivals of a decadent nobility, these shrinking, coquettish,
clinging, distant, tearful, proud, explosive, half barbarous, altogether
bewitching creatures. A suggestion here, a glimpse there,
an exclamation, a flash of the eyes, and they are alive and real
as few feminine creations in the fiction of any period. One may
forget the story, but one may not forget Madame Delphine. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
one would understand the secret of Cable's art, that Gallic
lightness of touch, that subtle elision, that perfect balance between
the suggested and the expressed, let him read the last chapter
of <i>The Grandissimes</i>. It is a Cable epitome.</p>

<p>"Posson Jone," "Jean-ah Poquelin," and <i>Madame Delphine</i>,
which, despite its length and its separate publication, is a short
story belonging to the <i>Old Creole Days</i> group, are among the
most perfect of American short stories and mark the highest
reach of Cable's art.</p>

<p><i>The Grandissimes</i>, his first long romance, appeared in 1880.
Never was work of art painted on broader canvas or with elements
more varied and picturesque. Though centering in a
little nook among the bayous, it contains all Louisiana. Everywhere
perspectives down a long past: glimpses of the explorers,
family histories, old forgotten wrongs, vendettas, survivals from
a feudal past, wild traditions, superstitions. Grandissime and
Fusilier, young men of the D'Iberville exploring party, get lost
in the swamps. "When they had lain down to die and had
only succeeded in falling to sleep, the Diana of the Tchoupitoulas,
ranging the magnolia groves with bow and quiver, came
upon them in all the poetry of their hope-forsaken strength and
beauty, and fell sick of love." The love of this Indian queen
begins the romance. Both eager to possess her, they can settle the
matter only with dice. Fusilier wins and becomes the founder
of a proud line, semibarbarous in its haughtiness and beauty,
the Capulets to De Grapion's Montagues. The culmination
comes a century later when the old feudal régime in Louisiana
was closed by Napoleon and the remnants of the warring families
were united according to the approved Montague-Capulet
formula.</p>

<p>But the theme of the book is wider than this quarrel of families,
wider than the conflict of two irreconcilable civilizations
and the passing of the outworn. In a vague way it centers in
the episode of Bras Coupé, the African king who refused to be
a slave and held firm until his haughty soul was crushed out with
inconceivable brutality. The cumulative and soul-withering
power of an ancient wrong, the curse of a dying man which works
its awful way until the pure love of innocent lovers removes it&mdash;it
is <i>The House of the Seven Gables</i> transferred to the barbarous
swamps of the Atchafalaya.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
The strangeness of the book grows upon one as one reads.
It is a book of lurid pictures&mdash;the torture and death of Bras
Coupé, the murder of the <i>négresse</i> Clemence, which in sheer horror
and brutal, unsparing realism surpasses anything in <i>Uncle
Tom's Cabin</i>, anything indeed in the Russian realists. It is a
book too with a monotone of fear: the nameless dread that comes
of holding down a race by force, or as Joel C. Harris has phrased
it, "that vague and mysterious danger that seemed to be forever
lurking on the outskirts of slavery, ready to sound a shrill and
ghostly signal in the impenetrable swamps and steal forth under
the midnight stars to murder and rapine and pillage"; the
superstitious thrill when at dead of night throbs up from a
neighboring slave yard "the monotonous chant and machine-like
time-beat of the African dance"; the horror of finding morning
after morning on one's pillow voodoo warnings and ghastly
death charms placed seemingly by supernatural hands. No one
has ever surpassed Cable in making felt this uncanny side of the
negro. His characterization of the voodoo quadroon woman
Palmyre with her high Latin, Jaloff-African ancestry, her "barbaric
and magnetic beauty that startled the beholder like the unexpected
drawing out of a jeweled sword," her physical perfection&mdash;lithe
of body as a tigress and as cruel, witching and alluring,
yet a thing of horror, "a creature that one would want to
find chained"&mdash;it fingers at one's heart and makes one fear.</p>

<p>And with all this strangeness, this flash after flash of vivid
characterization, a style to match. "Victor Hugo," one exclaims
often as one reads. Let us quote, say from chapter five.
The stars are Cable's:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There Georges De Grapion settled, with the laudable determination
to make a fresh start against the mortifyingly numerous Grandissimes.</p>

<p>"My father's policy was every way bad," he said to his spouse; "it is
useless, and probably wrong, this trying to thin them out by duels; we
will try another plan. Thank you," he added, as she handed his coat
back to him, with the shoulder-straps cut off. In pursuance of the new
plan, Madame De Grapion&mdash;the precious little heroine!&mdash;before the
myrtles offered another crop of berries, bore him a boy not much
smaller (saith tradition) than herself.</p>

<p>Only one thing qualified the father's elation. On that very day Numa
Grandissime (Brahmin-Mandarin de Grandissime), a mere child, received
from Governor De Vaudreuil a cadetship.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Messieurs Grandissime, go on with your tricks; we
shall see! Ha! we shall see!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span></p>
<p>"We shall see what?" asked a remote relative of that family. "Will
Monsieur be so good as to explain himself?"</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Bang! Bang!</p>

<p>Alas, Madame De Grapion!</p>

<p>It may be recorded that no affair of honor in Louisiana ever left a
braver little widow.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is French, too, in its sudden turns, its fragmentary paragraphs,
its sly humor, its swift summings-up with an epigram:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Now, sir," thought he to himself, "we'll return to our senses."</p>

<p>"Now I'll put on my feathers again," says the plucked bird.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">But as one reads on one realizes more and more that this style
comes from no mere imitation of a master: it is Creole; it is the
style that is the counterpart of the Creole temperament. It is
verisimilitude; it is interpretation.</p>

<p>Thus far the strength of the book; there are weaknesses as
great. Cable failed, as Harte failed, as most of the masters
of the short story have failed, in constructive power. The magnificent
thesis of the romance is not worked out; it is barely suggested
rather than made to dominate the piece. Moreover, the interest
does not accumulate and culminate at the end. It is a
rich mass of materials rather than a finished romance. The emphasis
is laid upon characters, episodes, conditions, atmosphere,
to the neglect of construction. From it Cable might have woven
a series of perfect short stories: some parts indeed, like the tale
of Bras Coupé, <i>are</i> complete short stories as they stand. The
book is a gallery rather than a single work of art.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Sevier</i>, 1885, marks the beginning of Cable's later style,
the beginning of the decline in his art. The year before he had
taken up his permanent residence in Massachusetts and now as
a literary celebrity, with Boston not far, he became self-conscious
and timid. His art had matured in isolation; there had been an
elemental quality about it that had come from his very narrowness
and lack of formal education. In the classic New England
atmosphere the Gallic element, the naïve simplicity, the elfin
charm that had made his early writings like no others, faded
out of his art. It was as if Burns after the Kilmarnock edition
had studied poetry at Oxford and then had settled in literary
London. <i>Doctor Sevier</i> is not a romance at all; it is a realistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
novel of the Howells type, a study of the Civil War period as
it had passed under Cable's own eyes, with no plot and no culminating
love interest. It is a running chronicle of ten years in
the lives of John and Mary Richling, tedious at times, impeded
with problem discussion and philosophizing. Its strength lies
in its characterization: the Italian Ristofalo and his Irish wife are
set off to the life; but why should the creator of Madame Delphine
and Posson Jone and Palmyre turn to Irish and Italian
characterization? The story, too, has the same defects as <i>The
Grandissimes</i>: it lacks proportion and balance. With a large
canvas Cable becomes always awkward and ineffective. With
<i>Bonaventure</i>, graphic as parts of it unquestionably are, one positively
loses patience. Its plan is chaotic. At the end, where
should come the climax of the plot, are inserted three long chapters
telling with minute and terrifying realism the incidents of
a flood in the canebrakes. It is magnificent, yet it is "lumber."
It is introduced apparently to furnish background for the death
of the "Cajun," but the "Cajun" is only an incidental figure
in the book. To deserve such "limelight" he should have been
the central character who had been hunted with increasing interest
up to the end and his crime and his punishment should
have been the central theme.</p>

<p>With <i>Madame Delphine</i> (1881) had closed the first and the
great period in Cable's literary career. The second period was
a period of miscellany: journalized articles on the history and
the characteristics of the Creoles, on New Orleans and its life,
on Louisiana, its history and traditions, on phases of social reform.
Necessary as this work may have been, one feels inclined
to deplore it. When one has discovered new provinces in the
realm of gold one does not well, it would seem, to lay aside his
magic flute and prepare guide books to the region.</p>

<p>The New England atmosphere brought to life a native area in
Cable. His mother had been of New England ancestry. Moral
wrestlings, questions of reform, problems of conscience, were a
part of his birthright. One feels it even in his earliest work:
he had seen, we feel, the problem of <i>The Grandissimes</i> before he
had found the story. After his removal to Northampton, Massachusetts,
it may be said that reform work became his real profession.
Not that we criticize his choice, for life ever is greater
than mere art; we record it simply because it explains. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
formed home culture clubs for the education and the esthetic
culture of wage-earners, and conducted a magazine in the interest
of the work; he interested himself actively in the cause of
the negro; so actively, indeed, that after his <i>Silent South</i> and
<i>The Negro Question</i> and the problem novel <i>John March, Southerner</i>,
the South practically disowned him.</p>

<p>His third period begins, perhaps, with his novel <i>Strong Hearts</i>
in 1899. The pen that so long had been dipped in controversy
and journalism and philanthropic propaganda again essayed
fiction, but it was too late. The old witchery was gone. His
later novels, all his fiction indeed after <i>Madame Delphine</i>, with
the exception perhaps of parts of <i>Bonaventure</i>, read as if written
by a disciple of the earlier Cable. The verve, the sly humor,
the Gallic finesse, the Creole strangeness and charm, have disappeared.
There is a tightening in the throat as one reads the
last page of <i>Madame Delphine</i>, there is a flutter of the heart as
one reads the love story of Honoré and Aurora, but nothing
grips one as he reads <i>The Cavalier</i>. A pretty little story, undoubtedly,
but is it possible that the author of it once wrote
"Posson Jone" and "Jean-ah Poquelin"? And <i>Gideon's
Band</i>, a romance with an attempt to win back the old witchery
of style&mdash;it was all in vain. Why say more?</p>

<p>Cable as a short story writer, a maker of miniatures with marvelous
skill of touch, was most successful perhaps with dainty
femininities of the old régime. Once, twice, thrice the light of
romance glowed upon his page. Then he became a reformer,
a journalist, a man with a problem. But he who gave to American
literature <i>Madame Delphine</i> and <i>Old Creole Days</i> need not
fear the verdict of coming days. Already have these works become
classics.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The old Spanish régime in America furnished the theme of
Lewis Wallace's (1827&ndash;1905) first romance, <i>The Fair God</i>, published
the year "'Sieur George" appeared in <i>Scribner's</i>. He
had returned from the Mexican War interested in Aztec antiquities.
After the Civil War, in which he took a prominent
part, he began in the intervals of his law practice to write a military
romance centering about Cortez and the conquest, and in
1873, through the efforts of Whitelaw Reid, succeeded in having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
it published in Boston. It was not, however, until 1884, after
the enormous popularity of <i>Ben Hur</i>, that it was discovered by
the reading public. It is really better in workmanship and
proportions than its more highly colored and vastly more exploited
companion; it moves strongly, its battle scenes have a
resonance and excitement about them that make them comparable
even with Scott's, but its tendency is to sentiment and melodrama:
it is a blending of Prescott and Bulwer-Lytton.</p>

<p>A far more distinctive study of old Spanish days is to be
found in Helen Hunt Jackson's <i>Ramona</i>, undoubtedly the
strongest romance of the period. Mrs. Jackson was a daughter
of Professor Nathan W. Fiske of Amherst, Massachusetts, and
until the last decade of her life was a resident of her native
New England. Not until she was thirty-five and had been bereft
of husband and children did she attempt literature. Her first
form of expression was poetry, the short, sharp cry of desolation,
narrowly personal and feminine. Then she wrote travel
sketches and juveniles and moral essays, and then an outpouring
of fiction intense and sentimental. During the seventies and the
early eighties her work was in all the magazines. So versatile
and abundant was she that at one time Dr. Holland seriously
contemplated an issue of <i>Scribner's</i> made up wholly of her contributions.</p>

<p>To almost nothing of her work, save that at the very last,
did she sign her own name. She had an aversion to publicity
that became really a mannerism. Her early work she signed
variously or not at all, then for a time she settled upon the initials
"H.&nbsp;H." It is no secret now that she wrote the much-speculated-upon
novels <i>Mercy Philbrick's Choice</i> and <i>Hetty's
Strange History</i> in the No-Name Series, and that the <i>Saxe Holm
Stories</i>, which furnished the literary mystery of the seventies,
were from her pen. They are love stories of the <i>Lamplighter</i>
school of fiction, sentimental, over-intense, moralizing. General
and colorless as most of them are, they here and there display a
rare power of characterization and a sharply drawn study of
background and conditions. Parts of "Farmer Bassett's Romance,"
with its analysis of the "pagan element" in New England
character, are worthy of Mary E. Wilkins. The stories,
however, belong with the old rather than the new, and have been
forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
It is impossible to understand "H.&nbsp;H." without taking into
account her New Englandism. She was a daughter of the
Brahmins, in many ways a counterpart of Elizabeth Stuart
Phelps&mdash;intensely conscientious, emotional, eager in the reform
of abuses, brilliant, impetuous. While visiting California in
the mid seventies she came in contact with the Indian problem
and with characteristic impulsiveness set out to arouse the nation.
After six months of intense work in the Lenox library
of New York she published her <i>Century of Dishonor</i>, a bitter
arraignment of the national Indian policy, and at her own expense
sent a copy to every member of Congress. As a result
she was appointed one of two commissioners to examine and report
upon "the condition and need of the Mission Indians of
California." Her report was thorough and businesslike, but it
accomplished little.</p>

<p>Then she conceived the purpose of enlarging her area of appeal
by the publication of a story&mdash;on the title page it stands
<i>Ramona. A Story</i>. The problem preceded plot and materials
and background. "You have never fully realized," she wrote
only a few weeks before her death, "how for the last four years
my whole heart has been full of the Indian cause&mdash;how I have
felt, as the Quakers say, 'a concern' to work for it. <i>My Century
of Dishonor</i> and <i>Ramona</i> are the only things I have done of
which I am glad <span class="locked">now."<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></span> And earlier than that she had written:
"I have for three or four years longed to write a story that
should 'tell' on the Indian question. But I knew I could not do
it; I knew I had no background&mdash;no local <span class="locked">color."<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ramona</i> was conceived of, therefore, as a tract, as a piece of
propaganda, like Elizabeth Stuart Phelps's <i>Loveliness</i>. It was
written with passion, flaming hot from a woman's heart&mdash;not
many have been the romances written in heat. In this one respect
it may be likened to Mrs. Stowe's great work, but to call
it, as so often it has been called, "the <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> of the
Indian," is to speak with inaptness. The book is a romance, and
only a romance; its whole appeal is the appeal of romance. She
had found at last her background, but it was a background that
dominated and destroyed her problem. Unconsciously she surrendered
herself to the charm of it until to-day the book is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
more a problem novel than is the <i>House of the Seven Gables</i>,
which also makes use of the excesses and crimes of a system.</p>

<p>No background could be more fitted for romance: southern
California with its "delicious, languid, semi-tropic summer";
the old Spanish régime, "half barbaric, half elegant, wholly
generous and free handed," "when the laws of the Indies were
still the law of the land, and its old name, 'New Spain,' was an
ever-present link and <span class="locked">stimulus";<a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></span> and over it all like a soft,
old-world atmosphere the Romish church with its mystery and
its medieval splendor. "It was a picturesque life, with more of
sentiment and gaiety in it, more also that was truly dramatic,
more romance, than will ever be seen again on those sunny
shores. The aroma of it all lingers there <span class="locked">still."<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>It had been the plan of the author first to elicit strongly the
reader's sympathy for Ramona and the Indian Alessandro, then
to harrow him with the persecutions wreaked upon them because
they were Indians. But the purpose fails from the start. Ramona's
Indian blood is not convincing to the reader. Until the
story is well under way no one of the characters except the
Señora and the priest, not even Ramona herself, suspects that she
is not a daughter of the old Spanish house of Ortegna. There
was small trace of the Indian about her: her beauty was by no
means Indian&mdash;steel blue eyes and "just enough olive tint in her
complexion to underlie and enrich her skin without making it
swarthy." She had been reared as a member of the patriarchal
household of the Morenos, and in education and habit of life
was as much Spanish as her foster brother Felipe. And Alessandro&mdash;even
the author explains that Ramona "looked at him
with no thought of his being an Indian&mdash;a thought there had
surely been no need of her having, since his skin was not a shade
darker than Felipe's." He is an Indian, we must admit, and
yet an Indian who looks like a Spaniard, an Indian who has been
educated carefully in the Mission like a priest, an Indian who
can sing Latin hymns with marvelous sweetness and play the
violin like a master, an Indian with all the characteristics of a
courtly señor, more nobly Spanish in soul than even Felipe
himself, the heir of the great Moreno estate&mdash;the imagination
refuses to accept either of the two characters as Indians. <i>Uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
Tom's Cabin</i> was worked out with the blackest of negroes; its
central figure was a typical slave, who died at the end a victim
of the system, but as one reads <i>Ramona</i> one thinks of Indians
only as incidental figures in the background.</p>

<p>It is a romance of the days of the passing of the haughty
old Spanish régime. A maiden of inferior birth, or, in terms of
the ordinary continental romance, a maiden whose mother was
of the peasant class, is brought up side by side and on a perfect
equality with the heir of the noble house. He falls in love with
her, but he tells of his love neither to her nor to his proud Castilian
mother, who alone in the family knows the secret of the
girl's birth. Then the maiden clandestinely marries, out of her
caste as all but the Señora supposes, a peasant, as her mother
had been a peasant, and is driven out of the home with harshness.
A tenderly reared maiden, married to poverty, forced
to live for a period in squalor, bereaved at last of her husband,
rescued by her old lover when she is at the lowest point of her
misery, and taken back to the old home where the implacable
mother has died, and there wooed until she surrenders her new
future to the high-born foster brother, who, even though he has
learned of her peasant strain, has never ceased to love her&mdash;that
is the romance. The Indians, even Alessandro, are felt to be
only incidental parts of the story. The center of the romance
is the slow, faithful, thwarted, but finally triumphing, love of
Felipe. The thing that really grips is not the incidental wrongs
and sufferings of the Indians, but the relentlessly drawn picture
of the old Señora and the last chapter where the two lovers,
united at last, have left behind them the old land, no longer
theirs&mdash;its deserted and melancholy Missions, its valleys and
long pastures which ring now with the shouts of a conquering
race, and turn their faces southward into a new world and a
new and more joyous life. Then it was that Ramona blossomed
into her full beauty. "A loyal and loving heart indeed it was&mdash;loyal,
loving, serene. Few husbands so blest as the Señor
Felipe Moreno. Sons and daughters came to bear his name.
The daughters were all beautiful; but the most beautiful of them
all, and, it was said, the most beloved by both father and mother,
was the eldest one: the one who bore the mother's name, and
was only step-daughter to the Señor&mdash;Ramona, daughter of Alessandro
the Indian." And so the romance ends, as romance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
should end, with all trouble and uncertainty a mere cloud in the
far past.</p>

<p><i>Ramona</i> is a bombshell that all unknowingly to its creator
turned out to be not a bombshell at all, but an exquisite work
of art. The intensity and the passion, which came from the
viewing of abuses and the desire to work reform, wove themselves
into the very substance of it. It is a blending of realism
and romanticism and ethic earnestness into a rounded romance.
More and more is it evident that aside from this and perhaps
two or three sonnets, nothing else that its author wrote is of
permanent value. <i>Ramona</i>, however, is alone enough to give
her a place in American literature, a place indeed with the two
or three best writers of American romance.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>The French occupation of the northern area of the continent
has also proved a rich literary field. It seems, as Howells has
observed, that the French have touched America "with romance
wherever they have touched it at all as soldiers, priests, exiles,
or mere adventurers." The bare history of their adventures is,
as Parkman has recorded it, romance. Cooper caught a glimpse
of the richness of the field, and a grand-niece of his, Constance
Fenimore Woolson, made a new discovery of it during the "local
color" period that followed the advent of Bret Harte. Her collection
of stories, <i>Castle Nowhere</i>, 1875, pictured with graphic
realism the life of the rude settlements along the upper lakes, but
once or twice she dipped her pen into pure romance and became
a pioneer. Her sketch, "The Old Agency," which deals with the
ancient building at Mackinac with its memories of the Jesuits,
and her strong story "St. Clair Flats" reveal what she might
have done had she not turned her attention to other regions.</p>

<p>The field that she abandoned was taken later by Mary Hartwell
Catherwood, a native of Ohio, the first woman novelist of
the period to be born west of the Alleghenies. She was, moreover,
the first woman of any prominence in American literary
ranks to acquire a college education, graduating not in the East,
as one might suppose, but from a new college in the new West.
The fact is significant. After a brief period of teaching in Illinois,
she became a newspaper writer and a general literary
worker, and she published her first book, <i>A Woman in Armor</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
as early as 1875. Juveniles, marketable stories, sketches, critiques,
flowed from her pen for nearly twenty years, and yet in
1888 she had settled upon no fixed style or field of work and she
was completely unknown to the reading public. She seems to
have been trying the literary currents of the time. Her first
experiment, not to mention her juveniles, was her <i>Craque-O'-Doom</i>,
1881, an E.&nbsp;P. Roe-like novel of the <i>He Fell in Love with
His Wife</i> type, but it made no impression. "Don't you know,"
she makes one of her characters say in words that are an explanation,
"that the key of the times is not sentiment but practical
common sense? Just after the war when the country was
wrought to a high pitch of nerves, current literature overflowed
with self-sacrifice. According to that showing&mdash;and current literature
ought to be a good reflection of the times&mdash;everybody
was running around trying to outdo his neighbor in the broken
heart and self-renunciation business." Next she assayed to enter
the "practical sense" school, and her "Serena," <i>Atlantic</i>, 1882,
with its unsparingly realistic picture of a death and funeral in
an Ohio farmhouse, shows that she might have made herself
the Miss Jewett or the Miss Wilkins of her native region. But
minute studies of contemporary life failed to satisfy the demands
within her. She awoke at last to her true vocation over a volume
of Parkman, let us suppose over the sixth and the sixteenth
chapters of <i>The Old Régime in Canada</i>. From the glowing
pages of this master of narrative she caught a full breath of romance
and for the first time she realized her powers.</p>

<p><i>The Romance of Dollard</i>, which appeared in the <i>Century</i> in
1888, and the other romances that swiftly followed, are no more
like the earlier work of the author than if they had been written
by another hand. It was as if a new and brilliant writer had
suddenly appeared. The suddenness, however, was only a seeming
suddenness: the romances were in reality the culmination
of a long and careful period of apprenticeship. Her style, to be
sure, had been influenced by Parkman: one cannot read a page
without feeling that. There is the same incisive, nervous manner;
the same impetuous rush and vigor as if the wild Northern
winds were filling the paragraphs; the same short and breathless
sentences in descriptions of action, packed with excitement
and dramatic force. Yet there is vastly more than Parkman in
her work. There is a wealth of poetry and spiritual force in it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
a healthy sentiment, a skilful selecting and blending of romantic
elements, and a Hardy-like power to catch the spirit of a locality
so as to make it almost a personality in the tragedy. This background
of wilderness, this monotone of the savage North, is never
absent. At the beginning of every story and every chapter is
struck, as it were, the dominating key. Here is the opening
paragraph of "The Windigo":</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The cry of those rapids in Ste. Marie's River called the Sault could
be heard at all hours through the settlement on the rising shore and
into the forest beyond. Three quarters of a mile of frothing billows,
like some colossal instrument, never ceased playing music down an inclined
channel until the trance of winter locked it up. At August dusk,
when all that shaggy world was sinking to darkness, the gushing monotone
became very distinct.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">These rapids with their mournful cry become a character in the
story; they dominate every page until at the end they rescue
the hero, bearing in his arms the frightful "windigo," in a
page of action that stirs the blood. The Canadian wilds of
the <i>coureurs de bois</i>, the roar of swollen rivers, the sudden storms
that lash the forests, the terror and the mystery of night in the
savage woods, and evermore the river, the black St. Lawrence&mdash;one
feels them like a presence. Like Cable, too, she can make
her reader share the superstitious thrill of the region. Her
<i>windigos</i> and <i>loup-garous</i> lay hold on one like a hand out of the
dark.</p>

<p>Amid this wild landscape a wild social order&mdash;savage Indians,
explorers, <i>voyageurs</i>, flaming Jesuits, <i>habitants</i>, <i>grands seigneurs</i>,
soldiers of fortune&mdash;Frontenac, Tonty, Dollard, La Salle, Bigot,
Montcalm, and perhaps the lost dauphin, son of Louis XVI and
Marie Antoinette&mdash;and in the heart of it all and the moving
force of it all, beautiful women, exiles from France, exquisite
maidens educated in convents, charmingly innocent, lithe Indian
girls, Indian queens, robust daughters of <i>habitants</i>. Swords
flash in duel and battle, love rules utterly even such stormy souls
as La Salle's, plots with roots that extend even across the ocean
into France are worked out in secret fastness&mdash;with such material
and such background romantic combinations are endless.</p>

<p>The strength of Mrs. Catherwood's work lies in its tensity
and excitement, its vigor of narrative, its picturesque setting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
its power of characterization. From this very element of strength
comes a weakness. Romance must tread ever near the verge of
the impossible, and at times she pushes her situations too far
and falls over into the realm of melodrama. In <i>The White
Islander</i>, for instance, the Indians have the hero burning at the
stake when suddenly Marie, the French "white islander" who
loves him, leaps into the circle of flames, declaring that she will
die with him. Then realizing there is no hope of saving the
two, the Jesuit father unites them in marriage, side by side at
the stake, while the flames are crackling, but the moment he
pronounces them man and wife the yells of the rescuing party
resound from the near forest and they are saved.</p>

<p>There is another weakness, one that lies far deeper, one indeed
that applies to the whole school of historical novelists that so
flourished in the nineties. The author had a passion for "documenting"
her romances. She studied her sources as carefully as
if she were to write a history; she used all the known facts that
could be found; then she supplemented these known facts copiously
from her imagination. For her <i>Romance of Dollard</i> she
got Parkman to write an introduction commending its historical
accuracy; she strewed the chapters with corroborating footnotes;
and she tried in all ways to give the impression that it was a
genuine piece of history. But there is no evidence that Dollard
ever married, and there is not a scrap even of tradition that his
bride died with him at the battle of the Long Saut. To make an
historical personage like Dollard or La Salle or Tonty the leading,
speaking character in a romance is to falsify the facts. Historical
romance is not history; it is pure fiction, true only to the
spirit of the age and the place represented and to the fundamentals
of human character and the ways of the human soul. It
should be worked out always with non-historical characters.</p>

<p>Of Mrs. Catherwood's romances the best is <i>The Lady of Fort
St. John</i>, made so perhaps on account of the unique character
Rossignol. Her strongest work, however, lies in her shorter
stories. It was a peculiarity of the whole period that nearly
all of its writers of fiction should have been restricted in their
powers of creation to the small effort rather than to the large.
It was the age of cameos rather than canvases. Her volume,
<i>The Chase of St. Castin and Other Stories of the French in the
New World</i>, and her <i>Mackinac and Lake Stories</i>, which deal with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
the mixed populations dwelling on the islands of the Great
Lakes, show her at her highest level. Her versatility, however,
was remarkable. Her <i>Spirit of an Illinois Town</i>, a realistic
story of a typical boom town, has in it the very soul of the new
West, and her <i>The Days of Jeanne d'Arc</i>, written after much
observation of the Vosges and Lorraine peasants in France and
a year of work in the best libraries, is as brilliant a piece of historical
work as was produced during the period.</p>

<p>Whatever her failings as a romancer she must be reckoned
with always as perhaps the earliest American pioneer of that
later school of historical fiction writers that so flourished in the
nineties. After her stirring tales had appeared, <i>Alice of Old
Vincennes</i>, and <i>Monsieur Beaucaire</i>, and <i>The Seats of the
Mighty</i>, and all the others, were foregone conclusions.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The latest field in America for romance was that created by
the Civil War. The patriarchal life of the great Southern
plantations had in it a peculiar picturesqueness, especially when
viewed through the fading smoke of the conflict that destroyed it.
An old aristocracy had been overthrown by Northern invaders&mdash;field
enough for romance. It had been a peculiar aristocracy&mdash;a
"democratic aristocracy," as it was fond of explaining itself,
"not of blood but of influence and of influence exerted among
<span class="locked">equals,"<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></span> but none the less it was an aristocracy in the heart of
democratic America, Roman in its patrician pride, its jealously
guarded principle of caste, its lavish wealth, and its slavery
centered, social régime. Like all aristocracies it was small in
numbers. "Only about 10,781 families held as many as fifty
or more slaves in 1860, and these may, without great error, be
taken as representing the number of the larger productive estates
of the <span class="locked">South."<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></span> But of these estates very many were only commercial
establishments with little social significance. The real
aristocracy was to be found in a few old families, notably in Virginia,
in numbers not exceeding the New England aristocracy of
the Brahmins, which had been set apart by a principle so
radically different. Both were narrowly provincial rather than
national, both were centered within themselves, both were intolerant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
and self-satisfied, and both alike disappeared in the flames
of the war to make way for the new national spirit which was to
rule the new age.</p>

<p>To feel the atmosphere of this Southern old régime, this exclusive
aristocracy, far older than the republic, one must read
Thomas Nelson Page's <i>The Old South</i>, or his earliest published
sketch, "Old Yorktown," <i>Scribner's Monthly</i>, 1881, a sketch
that is in reality the preface to his romances. It may be profitable,
perhaps, to quote a few paragraphs. After his description
of the old custom house of York, the first erected in America, he
writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There the young bucks in velvet and ruffles gathered to talk over the
news or plan new plots of surprising a governor or a lady-love. It
was there the haughty young aristocrats, as they took snuff or fondled
their hounds, probably laughed over the story of how that young fellow,
Washington, who, because he had acquired some little reputation fighting
Indians, had thought himself good enough for anybody, had courted
Mary Cary, and very properly had been asked out of the house of the
old Colonel, on the ground that his daughter had been accustomed to
ride in her own coach.... It would be difficult to find a fitter illustration
of the old colonial Virginia life than that which this little town
affords. It was a typical Old Dominion borough, and was one of the
eight boroughs into which Virginia was originally divided. One or two
families owned the place, ruling with a sway despotic in fact, though in
the main temperate and just, for the lower orders were too dependent
and inert to dream of thwarting the "gentlefolk," and the southerner
uncrossed was ever the most amiable of men.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Among these ruling families were the Nelsons and the Pages:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The founder of the Page family in Virginia was "Colonel John
Page," who, thinking that a principality in Utopia might prove better
than an acre in Middlesex, where he resided, came over in 1656. He
had an eye for "bottom land," and left his son Matthew an immense
landed estate, which he dutifully increased by marrying Mary Mann,
the rich heiress of Timber Neck. Their son, Mann, was a lad thirteen
years old when his father died. After being sent to Eton, he came
back and took his place at the "Council Board," as his fathers did before
him and as his descendants did after him.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">It reminds one of Hawthorne's account of his own family in the
introduction to <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>.</p>

<p>Before the war the South had had its romancers. Kennedy
and Simms and others had tried early to do for it what Cooper
had done for the more northerly area. Then in the fifties John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
Esten Cooke (1830&ndash;1886), the best novelist the South produced
during the earlier period, put forth a series of Virginia romances,
the strongest of which undoubtedly was <i>The Virginia Comedians</i>,
1854, republished in 1883. The strength of the book, as indeed
of all of Cooke's romances, lay in its vivacity, its enthusiasm, its
stirring pictures of the more picturesque elements of the old
Southern life: barbecues, horse races, contests between fiddlers,
the doings of negroes, and the like. Its weakness, in addition to
hasty workmanship and lack of cumulative power, was the common
weakness of all the mid-century fiction. It had a <i>St. Elmo</i>
atmosphere. Like all the rest of his fiction, it is tainted with
profuse sentimentality, with sensationalism, with a straining
for the unexpected and the picturesque. Panels in the wall slide
apart mysteriously, accidents happen in the nick of time, villains
in the form of French dancing masters are foiled at last by the
hero. One is in old Williamsburg, to be sure, "the Southern
Boston" in its golden prime, and is impressed with its courtly
manners, its beautiful women, its chivalrous heroes, its frequent
duels; yet one is never quite sure whether it is the real South or
whether it is not after all the story-world of an old-fashioned
romancer who perhaps has never visited the South at all save in
imagination. It is romanticism overdone; it is everything too
much. Even its sprightliness and its occasional touches of realism
cannot rescue it from oblivion.</p>

<p>A dwelling upon the merely quaint and unusual in the local
environment to arouse laughter and interest was perhaps the leading
source of failure in Southern fiction even to the time of the
later seventies. From the days of Longstreet's <i>Georgia Scenes</i>,
pictures there had been of the "cracker," the mountaineer, the
Pike, the conventional negro of the Jim Crow and the Zip Coon
or the Uncle Tom type, the colonel of the fire-eating, whisky-drinking
variety, but there had been no painstaking picture of
real Southern life drawn with loving hand, not for mirth and
wonder, not for the pointing of a moral, but for sympathy and
comprehension. Horace E. Scudder as late as 1880 noted that
"the South is still a foreign land to the North, and travelers are
likely to bring back from it only what does not grow in the
<span class="locked">North."<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></span> It was true also of travelers in its books as well, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
the most of its books had been written for Northern publication.
The first writer really to picture the South from the heart outward,
to show it not as a picturesque spectacle but as a quivering
section of human life, was Thomas Nelson Page (1853&mdash;&mdash;),
whose first distinctive story, "Marse Chan," appeared as late
as 1884.</p>

<p>At the opening of the Civil War Page was eight years old.
During the years of conflict his home, one of the great plantations
of Virginia, was a center of Confederate activities, and
time and again the region about it was overrun by the invading
armies. It was a marvelous training for the future novelist. He
had been born at precisely the right moment. He had been a
part of the old régime during the early impressionable years that
are golden in a life, the years that color and direct the imagination
in all its future workings, and he was young enough when
the era closed to adapt himself to the new order. At the close
of the war he studied the classics with his father, a scholar of
the old Southern type, took the course in the Virginia university
presided over by Robert E. Lee, studied law at the University
of Virginia, and then from 1875 to 1893 practised law in Richmond.
These are the essentials of his biography.</p>

<p>It was while he was establishing himself in his profession at
the old capital of the Confederacy that he did his first literary
work. <i>Scribner's Monthly</i> had heard from the ruined South
the first murmurings of a new literature and was giving it every
encouragement. It had published King's series of articles on <i>The
Great South</i>, it had discovered Cable in 1873, it had encouraged
Lanier, and in January, 1876, it had begun to issue a series of
negro dialect poems by Irwin Russell, a native of Port Gibson,
Mississippi, poems that undoubtedly had been suggested by the
Pike balladry, and yet were so fresh and original in material and
manner that they in turn became a strong influence on their times.
That the poems launched Page in his literary career he has
freely admitted.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Personally I owe much to him. It was the light of his genius shining
through his dialect poems&mdash;first of dialect poems then and still first&mdash;that
led my feet in the direction I have since tried to follow. Had he
but lived, we should have had proof of what might be done with true
negro dialect; the complement of "Uncle <span class="locked">Remus."<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
In April, 1877, came his first contribution to <i>Scribner's</i>,
"Uncle Gabe's White Folks," a dialect poem of the Russell
order, yet one that strikes the keynote of all its author's later
work:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fine ole place? Yes, sah, 't is so;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">An' mighty fine people my white folks war&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But you ought ter 'a' seen it years ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When de Marster an' de Mistis lived up dyah;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When de niggers 'd stan' all roun' de do',<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like grains o' corn on de cornhouse flo'.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">Together with Armistead C. Gordon of Staunton, Virginia, he
wrote other ballads and poetical studies which were issued as a
joint volume a decade later with the title <i>Befo' de War, Echoes
in Negro Dialect</i>. But in the meantime he had been experimenting
with prose dialect, and late in the seventies he submitted
to the magazine a long story told wholly in the negro vernacular.
It was a bold venture: even <i>Scribner's</i> hesitated. They might
print humorous dialect poems and Macon's "Aphorisms from
the Quarters" in their "Bric-à-Brac" department, but a serious
story all of it in a dialect that changed many words almost beyond
recognition&mdash;they held it for over four years. When
it did appear, however, as "Marse Chan" in 1884, it seemed
that their fears had been groundless. It was everywhere hailed
as a masterpiece. "Unc' Edinburg's Drowndin'," "Meh Lady,"
and others quickly followed, and in 1887 the series was issued
as a collection with the title <i>In Ole Virginia</i>, a book that is to
Page what <i>The Luck of Roaring Camp</i> is to Harte and <i>Old
Creole Days</i> is to Cable.</p>

<p>The method of Page in these early stories was original. The
phrase "befo' de war" explains it. He would reproduce the
atmosphere of the old South, or what is more nearly the truth,
the atmosphere of aristocratic old Virginia plantation life. "No
doubt the phrase 'Before the war' is at times somewhat abused.
It is just possible that there is a certain Caleb Balderstonism in
the speech at times. But for those who knew the old county
as it was then, and contrast it with what it has become since, no
wonder it seems that even the moonlight was richer and mellower
'before the war' than it is now. For one thing, the moonlight
as well as the sunlight shines brighter in our youth than in maturer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
<span class="locked">age."<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></span> But Page expressed the phrase in negro dialect&mdash;"befo'
de war." The story of the vanished era, the gallantry
and spirit of its men, the beauty of its women, the nameless glow
that hovers over remembered youthful days, he would show
through the medium of the negro. It is exquisite art done with
seemingly impossible materials. An old slave tells the story in
his own picturesque way and wholly from his own viewpoint, yet
so simply, so inevitably, that one forgets the art and surrenders
oneself as one surrenders to actual life with its humor and its
pathos and its tragedy. It is romance&mdash;an idealized world, and
an idealized negro. Surely no freed slave ever told a consecutive
tale like that, perfect in its proportions and faultless in its
lights and shadows, yet such a criticism never for a moment
occurs to the reader. The illusion is complete. The old South
lives again and we are in it both in sympathy and comprehension.</p>

<p>In the decade that followed this first book Page gave himself to
the writing of short stories and studies of Southern life, but
only once or twice did he catch again the magic atmosphere of
the earlier tales. <i>Two Little Confederates</i> is exquisite work, but
<i>Elsket</i>, which followed, was full of inferior elements. Its negro
stories, "George Washington's Last Duel" and "P'laski's Tunament,"
are only good vaudeville&mdash;they show but the surface of
negro life; "Run to Seed" is pitched almost with shrillness, and
"Elsket" and "A Soldier of the Empire," the one dealing with
the last of her race, the other with the last of his order, are
European sketches a trifle theatrical in spite of their touches
of pathos.</p>

<p><i>Red Rock</i> (1898) marks the beginning of Page's second period,
the period of long romances. Once before with <i>On Newfound
River</i> he had tried the border canvas and he had failed save
in certain of his characterizations and detached episodes. Now
with <i>Red Rock</i> he set out to write what should stand among his
works as <i>The Grandissimes</i> stands among Cable's. Its sub-title,
<i>A Chronicle of Reconstruction</i>, explains at once its strength and
its weakness. Its author approached it as Mrs. Jackson had
approached <i>Ramona</i>, with a purpose, and, unlike Mrs. Jackson,
he accomplished his purpose. The wrongs of the South during
the period are made vivid, but at the expense of the novel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
The opening pages are perfect. Chapter two with its merry-making
at the great plantation, and all its glimpses of traits
and scenes peculiarly Southern, leads the reader to feel that
he has in his hands at last the great romance of Southern life.
There is the background of an ancient wrong. The red stain
on the great rock is supposed to be the blood of the first mistress
of the plantation murdered there by an Indian; and the haunting
picture over the fireplace of the first master who had killed the
Indian with his bare hands, then had glared from his portrait
until he had become the dominating center of the plantation, is
felt to be the dominating center also of the romance as the Bras
Coupé episode is the motif of <i>The Grandissimes</i>. But one is
soon disappointed. The problem dominates the romance; the
book is primarily a treatise, a bit of special pleading. It is undoubtedly
all true, but one set out to read a romance of the old
South. True as its facts may be, from the art side it is full of
weaknesses. Leech, the carpet-bagger, and Still, the rascally
overseer, are villains of the melodramatic type; they are a dead
black in character from first to last. The turning points of
the action are accidents, the atmosphere is too often that of
<i>St. Elmo</i>. When the master is killed in battle the picture of
the Indian killer falls to the hearth, and again when Leech is
beating to death the wounded heir to the estate it falls upon the
assassin as if in vengeance and nearly crushes him. The plot is
chaotic. We are led to believe that Blair Cary, the doctor's
daughter, who in the opening chapters is as charming as even
Polly herself in <i>In Ole Virginia</i>, is to be the central figure, but
Blair is abandoned for no real reason and Miss Welsh, a Northern
girl, finishes the tale. Jacquelin, too, who dominates the
earlier pages, peters out, and it is not clear why Middleton, the
Northern soldier, is brought in near the close of the book, perhaps
to marry Blair, who by every right of romance belongs to
Jacquelin. It is enough to say that the story is weak just
as <i>Gabriel Conroy</i> is weak, just as <i>The Grandissimes</i> and <i>Pembroke</i>
are weak. The materials are better than the construction.</p>

<p>The fame of Page then must stand or fall, as Harte's must, or
Cable's or Miss Wilkins's, on the strength of his first book. His
essays on the Old South and other volumes are charming and
valuable studies, his novels are documents in the history of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
stirring era, but his <i>In Ole Virginia</i> is a work of art, one of the
real classics of American literature.</p>

<p>Several others have used Virginia as a background for romance,
notably Mary Virginia Terhune, (1831&mdash;&mdash;), who wrote
under the pseudonym "Marion Harland" something like twenty
novels, the most of them in the manner in vogue before 1870, and
F. Hopkinson Smith (1838&ndash;1915), whose <i>Colonel Carter of Cartersville</i>
(1891) is one of the most sympathetic studies of Southern
life ever written. Its sly humor, its negro dialect, its power
of characterization, its tender sentiment, its lovable, whimsical
central figure, and its glimpses of an old South that has forever
disappeared, make it one of the few books of the period concerning
which one may even now prophesy with confidence.</p>

<span class="subhead">LATER POETS OF THE SOUTH</span></h2>

<p>The year 1866 saw the low-water mark, perhaps, not only of
the American novel, but of American literature generally. On
May 12 of this year <i>The Round Table</i> of New York, in an editorial
entitled "Plain Talk with American Writers," declared
that "The literary field was never so barren, never so utterly
without hope of life.... The era of genius and vigor that
seemed ready to burst on us only a few months ago has not been
fulfilled. There is a lack of boldness and power. Men do not
seem to strike out in new paths as bravely as of old." Then it
issued a challenge to the new generation of literary men: "We
have very little strong, original writing. Who will awaken us
from this sleep? Who will first show us the first signs of a
genuine literary reviving?... If ever there was a time when a
magnificent field opened for young aspirants for literary renown,
that time is the present. Every door is wide open."</p>

<p>We know now that the reviving was close at hand. Within five
years the flood-gates were opened, and Clemens, Harte, Hay,
Burroughs, Howells, Miller, and all the group were publishing
their first work. Among others a young Georgia school-teacher
felt the thrill as he read the <i>Round Table</i> call, and he made haste
to send to the paper a budget of poems&mdash;"Barnacles," "Laughter
in the Senate," and some others, to be, if possible, the first
fruits of this new period. A year later, in 1867, he went himself
to New York to bring out a novel, <i>Tiger Lilies</i>, a book sent forth
with eagerness and infinite hope, for was not every door wide
open? It is a book to linger over: crude as it is, it was the first
real voice from the new South.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>The little group of Southern poets that had gathered itself
about Paul Hamilton Hayne (1831&ndash;1886), the chief of whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
were Margaret Junkin Preston (1820&ndash;1897), Francis Orrery
Ticknor (1822&ndash;1874), and Henry Timrod (1829&ndash;1867)&mdash;poets
who were contemporary with Bayard Taylor and his group&mdash;belongs
rather with the period before the war than with the new
national period that followed it. They were poets of beauty like
Stoddard, singing the music of Keats and Tennyson and the old
Cavalier poets&mdash;dreamers, makers of dainty conceits and pretty
similes, full of grace and often of real melody, but with little
originality either of manner or message. The war came into their
lives sharply and suddenly, a cataclysm that shook all their plans
into ruins about them. It swept away their property, their
homes, their libraries, even their health. For a time during the
conflict they turned their poetry into martial channels: invectives
on the invading "Huns," rallying songs, battle lyrics,
patriotic calls. When the war was over they found themselves
powerless to adjust themselves. Hayne before the war was a
graceful sonneteer, a worshiper of classic beauty, a writer of
odes, not to the nightingale but to the mocking bird:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A golden pallor of voluptuous light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Filled the warm southern night:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moon, clear orbed, above the sylvan scene<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moved like a stately queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So rife with conscious beauty all the while,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What could she do but smile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At her own perfect loveliness below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glassed in the tranquil flow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of crystal fountains and unruffled streams?<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">Even his war poems are gentle and softly poetic. After the war
he lapsed into lyrics of retrospect and contemplation with a
minor note always of gentle resignation. He lived to write
elegies on Timrod and Lanier and to make himself the threnodist
of the old South:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Forgotten! Tho' a thousand years should pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Methinks our air will throb with memory's thrills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A common grief weigh down the faltering grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A pathos shroud the hills;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waves roll lamenting; autumn sunsets yearn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the old time's return.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>A more sensitively imaginative poet was Timrod, yet even he
was not strong enough to lead his time and become more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
a minor singer. He was of the old South and would have been
wholly out of place in the new even had he lived. More fire and
Hebraic rage there were in him than in Hayne, indeed than in
any other American poet save Whittier. Once or twice when his
life was shaken to the center by the brutalities of war he burst
into cries that still quiver with passion:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh! standing on this desecrated mold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Methinks that I behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifting her bloody daisies up to God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spring kneeling on the sod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And calling with the voice of all her rills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the ancient hills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fall and crush the tyrants and the slaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That turn her meads to graves.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">And again at the climax of "The Cotton Boll":</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, help us, Lord! to roll the crimson flood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back on its course, and, while our banners wing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Northward, strike with us! till the Goth shall cling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his own blasted altar-stones, and crave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mercy; and we shall grant it, and dictate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lenient future of his fate<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p class="in0">But it was like pouring molten bullet lead from Satsuma vase.
The fragile, beautiful life that should have known nothing harsher
than the music of poets and the laughter of children and lovers,
broke under the strain of war and poverty and neglect, and his
life went out miserably at thirty-eight.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Sidney Lanier's life was as brief as Timrod's and as full of
harshness and poverty, but the end of the war found him young
enough to have resiliency and the ability to adapt himself to the
new régime of which willy-nilly he found himself a part. He
was thirteen years younger than Timrod and twelve years younger
than Hayne. His temperament was different: he was broader in
his sympathies&mdash;no man ever threw himself more completely into
the cause of the Confederacy, yet a decade after the war we find
him with a nation-wide vision of the new era; he was more democratic
of soul than Hayne or Timrod&mdash;he could worship beauty
as passionately as they and he could also write ballads of the
Pike County order; he suffered just as acutely from the war as
did Timrod, yet one may search long through his poems or his
letters for a single despondent note. He was buoyant and impetuous:
his winning of literary recognition in the face of physical
disabilities seemingly insuperable places him beside Parkman.</p>

<p>In point of time Lanier was the first of what may be called
the Georgia school of writers. It is notable that the State most
harshly dealt with by the war was the first to arise from its ruins,
the first to receive the vision of a new South, and the first to
catch the new national spirit. Macon, Lanier's birthplace, had
about it all the best elements of the Old South. It was the seat
of an influential college for women, it possessed a cultured society,
and it had an art atmosphere&mdash;music, poetry, literary conversation&mdash;unusual
in that period outside of New England and some
of the larger cities. Lanier's home was in every way ideal: his
father, a lawyer of the old Southern type, was "a man of considerable
literary acquirements and exquisite taste," and, moreover,
like most Southerners of his class, he had a library stocked
with the older classics, a treasure-house of which his son, bookish
from his earliest childhood, made the fullest use. "Sir Walter
Scott, the romances of Froissart, the adventures of Gil Bias,"
all the older poets&mdash;he read them until he seemed to his boyish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
companions as one who lived apart in a different world from
theirs.</p>

<p>His formal schooling was meager, yet at fifteen he was able to
enter the sophomore class of Oglethorpe University, a small denominational
college at Midway, Georgia, and in 1860 he was
ready for graduation with the highest honors of his class. Compared
with the larger Northern institutions, the college was pitifully
primitive; Lanier in later years could even call it "farcical,"
nevertheless it is doubtful if any university could have
done more for the young poet. It brought him in contact with
a man, James Woodrow of the department of science, a man who
was to become later the president of the University of South Carolina
and the author of the famous book, <i>An Examination of Certain
Recent Assaults on Physical Science</i> (1873).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Such a man," says his biographer, "coming into the life of Lanier
at a formative period, influenced him profoundly. He set his mind
going in the direction which he afterwards followed with great zest,
the value of science in modern life and its relation to poetry and religion.
He also revealed to him the meaning of genuine <span class="locked">scholarship."<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">This influence it may have been which made Lanier in later years
so tolerant and so broad of view. The attraction between pupil
and teacher seems to have been mutual. Through Woodrow it
was that Lanier received his appointment as tutor in the college,
a position which he held during the year that followed.</p>

<p>It was a year of close study and of wide reading. Throughout
his undergraduate period he had read enormously: often in unusual
books: Burton's <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>, Jeremy Taylor,
Keats's <i>Endymion</i>, Chatterton, Christopher North, Tennyson,
whose <i>Maud</i> he learned by heart, Carlyle, and a long list of others.
"Without a doubt it was Carlyle who first enkindled in Lanier a
love of German literature and a desire to know more of that
language." He studied with eagerness. His dream now was to
enter a German university and do scholarly work as Basil Gildersleeve
had just done, and Thomas R. Price, two other young men
of the new South, but suddenly as he dreamed all his life plans
fell in ruins about him. The crash of war resounded in his ears.
All in a moment he found himself in an atmosphere of fierce
excitement. The college became an armed camp; Macon became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
a military center. Before he had fairly realized it the young
tutor, just turned twenty, had enlisted in the first company to
leave the State, and was marching away to the front.</p>

<p>His career as a soldier need not detain us. It was varied and
it was four years long and it ended dramatically on the stormy
night of November 2, 1864, when the Federal cruiser <i>Santiago-de-Cuba</i>
picked up the blockade runner <i>Lucy</i> off Wilmington,
North Carolina, and sent her crew, among them signal officer
Lanier, to Point Lookout prison. A fellow prisoner and a close
friend during the hard days that followed was another Southern
poet, John Bannister Tabb (1845&ndash;1909), whose brief lyrics as we
know them to-day possess beauty and finish and often distinction.</p>

<p>Lanier was released in March, 1865, and after incredible hardships
succeeded in reaching his home in Macon more dead than
alive to find his mother dying of consumption. The poet's tendency
to the disease was congenital; the prison hardships and exposure
had broken down his physical vigor; and two years later
while teaching a small country school in Prattville, Alabama, as
he was forced to do by the poverty of the South and his own lack
of money or profession, hemorrhages from the lungs began, and
the rest of his life, like Stevenson's under the same conditions,
was a fight with tuberculosis, a perpetual changing from place
to place that he might find some climate that would afford relief.
With unparalleled heroism he fought off the disease for
fifteen years, and under physical weakness that would have sent
the average man to his bed and his grave he made himself
recognized as the leading poetic voice of the new South, and one
of the few poetic voices of his era.</p>

<p>His life divides itself into three periods: the first one his time
of dreaming, as he himself styled it&mdash;his boyhood, ending with
the call to arms in 1861; the second his period of storm and stress,
his period of struggle and uncertainty and final adjustment, ending
in 1873 with his determination to devote his life to music and
poetry; and finally the seven or eight years in which eagerly and
unremittingly, with failing health and long periods of total incapacity,
he wrote all those books and poems for which he is now
known.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Lanier's work more than that of any other writer of his time
illustrates the difference between the mid-century literature and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
that of the later national period. He is distinctively a transition
figure: he heard both voices and he obeyed both. Until after the
war he was what Hayne and Timrod had been, and Taylor and
Stoddard&mdash;a disciple of Keats, a poet of merely sensuous beauty.
But for the war he would have been a Longfellow bringing from
Germany <i>Hyperions</i> and <i>Voices of the Night</i>. The four vital
years in the camps, on the blockade runner, in the military prison,
with their close contact with life in its elemental conditions, was
a university course far different from any that he had dreamed
of in his college days. It was this that differentiates him from
Hayne and Timrod and that brings him into our period.</p>

<p><i>Tiger Lilies</i>, his first published book (1867), is a document not
only in the life of Lanier but also in the transition period of the
sixties. It is a crude first novel full of a strange mixture of weakness
and strength. It has been likened to Longfellow's <i>Hyperion</i>,
but the likeness extends no further than this: <i>Tiger Lilies</i> is the
novel transitional to the seventies as <i>Hyperion</i> was transitional
to the romantic thirties and forties. In parts it belongs completely
to the older period. It opens with this outburst, not by Paul
Fleming, but by Paul Rübetsahl:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Himmel! Cospetto! Cielo! May our nests be built on the strongest
and leafiest bough of the great tree Ygdrasil! May they be lined
with love, soft and warm, and may the storms be kind to them: Amen
and Amen!" said Paul Rübetsahl.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The first part is florid in the extreme and artificial, full of literary
affectations and conceits:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the last day of September, 1860, huntsman Dawn leapt out of
the East, quickly ran to earth that old fox, Night, and sat down on the
top of Smoky Mountain to draw breath, etc.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Its discussions of poetry, of music, of the meaning of art and of
life generally are all in the dream-world of German romance, and
its chaotic plot and its impossible characters and happenings are
in full keeping. But with part two the book comes suddenly to
life. The hero enters the war and all at once there is realism,
passages like this as graphic even as Whitman:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The wounded increase. Here is a musket in the road: there is the
languid hand that dropped it, pressing its fingers over a blue edged
wound in the breast. Weary pressure, and vain&mdash;the blood flows
steadily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
More muskets, cartridge-boxes, belts, greasy haversacks, strew the
ground.</p>

<p>Here come the stretcher-bearers. They leave a dripping line of
blood. "Walk easy as you kin, boys," comes from the blanket which
the men are carrying by the corners. Easy walking is desirable when
each step of your four carriers spurts out the blood afresh or grates
the rough edges of a shot bone in your leg.</p>

<p>The sound of a thousand voices, eager, hoarse, fierce, all speaking
together yet differently, comes through the leaves of the undergrowth.
A strange multitudinous noise accompanies it&mdash;a noise like the tremendous
sibilation of a mile-long wave just before it breaks. It is the
shuffling of two thousand feet as they march over dead leaves.</p></blockquote>

<p>The novel is laid in the Tennessee Mountains in the same region
that was to figure a decade later in the stories of Charles Egbert
Craddock. The Great Smoky Mountains and Chilhowee Mountain&mdash;familiar
names now&mdash;form the background, but the author
puts no individuality into the landscape. It might be Germany.
His mountaineers, however, are alive and they are sharply characterized.
Gorm Smallin and his brother Cain are among the
earliest figures in that vast gallery of realistically portrayed local
types that soon was to figure so prominently in American literature.
The chapter that records the desertion of Gorm and his
arraignment by his brother Cain is worthy of standing with the
best work of Charles Egbert Craddock or Octave Thanet. The
prison scenes, drawn from the author's own first-hand experience,
are documents in the history of the war. On every line is the
stamp of reality. Here is a bivouac scene:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Cain Smallin sat, stiff backed upon the ground, sternly regarding
his packed circle of biscuits in the skillet.</p>

<p>"How do they come on, Cain? Most done?"...</p>

<p>"Bully! Brownin' a little some of 'em. 'Bout ten minutes yit."</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">At that moment a shell that has buried itself in the ground explodes
in the midst of the group, literally burying the party and
scattering havoc. Cain Smallin, unhurt, digs himself from the
ruins and scrapes the dirt from his face.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Boys," said he, in a broken voice of indignant but mournful inquiry,
"have any of ye seed the skillet?"</p></blockquote>

<p>In the words of its preface, the book was a cry, "a faint cry,
sent from a region where there are few artists, to happier lands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
who own many; calling on these last for more sunshine and less
night in their art.... There are those even here in the South
who still love beautiful things with sincere passion."</p>

<p>But necessity was upon the young dreamer. He was without
a profession, and he had married a wife. There was no refuge
but his father's profession, which always had been the last as well
as the first resort of young Southerners. His father's law firm
was glad to employ him, though it could offer but meager compensation.
No more novels, no more dreams of the scholar's life,
of Heidelberg, and poetry. Until 1873 he was busy, like Cable
during the same period, with his conveyances and his bills of sale.
The ambitious plan of a long poem of medieval France, "The
Jacquerie," he kept in his desk, a beautiful dream that often
he returned to. He wrote exquisite little songs for it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">May the maiden,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Violet-laden<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the violet sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Comes and hovers<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Over lovers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over thee, Marie, and me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Over me and thee.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>His poetic experiments of this period one may find at the back
of the definitive edition of his work. With Timrod and Hayne he
was still dreamy and imaginative, more prone to look at the beautiful
than at the harsher realities of humanity, yet even as he
was dreaming over his "Jacquerie" he was not oblivious to the
problems of his own time. He wrote dialect poems: "Jones's
Private Argument," "Thar's More in the Man than Thar Is in
the Land," "Nine from Eight," and the like, and published them
in Southern papers. They deal with the Georgia "Crackers" and
with the social and financial conditions of the times, and they were
written in 1868, two years before the Pike County balladry. In
1875 with his brother Clifford he published in <i>Scribner's Monthly</i>
"The Power of Prayer; or, the First Steamboat up the Alabama,"
a negro dialect poem adapted undoubtedly from a similar episode
recounted in Mark Twain's <i>The Gilded Age</i>, yet original in tone
and realistically true. Had it been unsigned we should attribute
it without hesitation to Irwin Russell, who by many is believed to
have been the first to discover the literary possibilities of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
negro, at least in the field of poetic balladry. How like Russell
is a stanza like this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It 'pear to me dis mornin' I kin smell de fust o' June.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I 'clar', I b'lieve dat mockin'-bird could play de fiddle soon!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dem yonder town-bells sounds like dey was ringin' in de moon.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">But Russell's first poem, "Uncle Cap Interviewed," appeared in
<i>Scribner's</i> almost a year later. The Lanier brothers contributed
to the magazine at least one more dialect poem, "Uncle Jim's
Baptist Revival Hymn," a product as realistically true to the
negro as anything written later by Harris or Page:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sin's rooster's crowed, Ole Mahster's riz,<br /></span>

<span class="i2"><span class="chorus"><i>Chorus.</i></span> <i>Dey's mightily in de grass, grass,</i><br /></span>

<span class="i2"><i>Dey's mightily in de grass, grass,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>Dey's mightily in de grass.</i> Etc.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">Lanier was a pioneer in a rich field.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The turning point came in 1873. The poet's physical condition
had become so alarming that he had been sent to spend the winter
at San Antonio, Texas. He found what least he was looking for.
The German Maennerchor of the city, an unusual circle of musicians,
discovered him and asked him to play to them the flute,
an instrument that had been his companion since boyhood. "To
my utter astonishment," he wrote his wife, "I was master of the
instrument. Is not this most strange? Thou knowest I had
never learned it; and thou rememberest what a poor muddle I
made at Marietta in playing difficult passages; and I certainly
have not practised; and yet there I commanded and the blessed
notes obeyed me, and when I had finished, amid a storm of applause,
Herr Thielepape arose and ran to me and grasped my
hand, and declared that he hat never heert de flude accompany
itself <span class="locked">pefore."<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
Judging from contemporary testimony, we are compelled to
rate Lanier as a musical genius. Though he never had had
formal training in the art, from his childhood music had been
with him a consuming passion. He had taken his flute to the
war, he had smuggled it into the prison, and he had moved all his
life amid a chorus of exclamations over the magic beauty of his
improvisations. The masters were praising him now: he would
be a master himself. He would toil no longer at the task he
despised; he would live now for art. In November, 1873, he
wrote to his father:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>How can I settle myself down to be a third-rate struggling lawyer
for the balance of my little life, as long as there is a certainty almost
absolute that I can do something so much better? Several persons,
from whose judgment in such matters there can be no appeal, have
told me, for instance, that I am the greatest flute-player in the world;
and several others, of equally authoritative judgment, have given me
an almost equal encouragement to work with my pen. My dear father,
think how, for twenty years, through poverty, through pain, through
weariness, through sickness, through the uncongenial atmosphere of a
farcical college and of a bare army and then of an exacting business
life, through all the discouragement of being wholly unacquainted with
literary people and literary ways&mdash;I say, think how, in spite of all
these depressing circumstances, and of a thousand more which I could
enumerate, these two figures of music and poetry have steadily kept in
my heart so that I could not banish them. Does it not seem to you
as to me, that I begin to have the right to enroll myself among the
devotees of these two sublime arts, after having followed them so long
and so humbly, and through so much bitterness?<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>He gave himself first to music. So perfect was his mastery
of his instrument that he secured without difficulty the position
of first flute in Hamerik's Peabody Orchestra of Baltimore, and
he played at times even with Thomas's Orchestra of New York.
It was the opinion of Hamerik, himself a rare artist, that Lanier
was a musician of highest distinction:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>His human nature was like an enchanted instrument, a magic flute,
or the lyre of Apollo, needing but a breath or a touch to send its beauty
out into the world.... In his hands the flute no longer remained a
mere material instrument, but was transformed into a voice that set
heavenly harmonies into vibration. Its tones developed colors, warmth,
and a low sweetness of unspeakable poetry&mdash;His playing appealed
alike to the musically learned and to the unlearned&mdash;for he would
magnetize the listener; but the artist felt in his performance the superiority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
of the momentary inspiration to all the rules and shifts of mere
technical scholarship. His art was not only the art of art, but an art
above art. I will never forget the impression he made on me when he
played the flute concerta of Emil Hartman at a Peabody symphony
concert, in 1878&mdash;his tall, handsome, manly presence, his flute breathing
noble sorrows, noble joys, the orchestra softly responding. The audience
was spellbound. Such distinction, such refinement! He stood
the master, the <span class="locked">genius.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>His first recognition as a poet came in 1875 with the publication
of "Corn" in <i>Lippincott's Magazine</i>. The poem caught the
attention of Taylor and brought to the poet the commission to furnish
the words for the Cantata to be sung at the Centennial Exposition.
After that commission Lanier was a national figure.</p>

<p>During the scant six years that followed, the years of his literary
life in which he wrote all that is distinctive in his poetry,
he lived in a whirlwind of activity, of study in the large libraries
to which he now had access, of music, of literary hack-work, or he
lay totally incapacitated by sickness that threatened always the
speedy termination of all. Poetry he could write only in moments
stolen from more imperative things. He compiled a guide book
to Florida, he prepared courses of lectures on Shakespeare for
clubs of women, he delivered two scholarly courses of lectures at
Johns Hopkins University, and he published four juveniles that
adapted for boys the old romances of chivalry. He wrote lyrics
and songs, but his future as a poet must rest on five poems:
"Corn," the first significant poem from the new South; "The
Symphony," a latter-day ode to St. Cecilia; "The Psalm of the
West," which he intended should do for the centennial year what
Taylor had failed so lamentably to do in his Fourth of July ode;
"The Marshes of Glynn," a symphony without musical score;
and, finally on his death bed, held in life only by his imperious
will, "Sunrise," his most joyous and most inspired improvisation
of all.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>For Lanier was essentially an improvisatore. He left behind
him no really finished work: he is a poet of magnificent fragments.
He was too excited, too impetuous, to finish anything. Poetry
was a thing of rhapsodic outbursts, of tiptoe glimpses: his eager
jottings for poems made on the backs of envelopes, scraps of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
paper, anything that was at hand, fill a volume. He may be
likened to a child in a meadow of daisies: he filled his hands, his
arms, full of the marvelous things, then threw them aside to
gather more and ever more. There was no time to arrange them,
no time even to look at them twice. Ideas came in flocks; he lived
in a tumult of emotion. His letters quiver with excitement as do
those of no other American poet. "All day my soul hath been
cutting swiftly into the great space of the subtle, unspeakable
deep, driven by wind after wind of heavenly melody." "I cannot
tell you with what eagerness I devoured <i>Felix Holt</i>." "My
heart was all a-cry." "The fury of creation is on me to-day."
"Lying in the music-waters, I floated and flowed, my soul utterly
bent and prostrate." "The very inner spirit and essence of all
wind-songs, bird-songs, passion-songs, folk-songs, country-songs,
sex-songs, soul-songs, and body-songs hath blown me in quick
gusts like the breath of passion and sailed me into a sea of vast
dreams." One may quote interminably.</p>

<p>Hamerik's characterization of his flute-playing may be taken
as the key to all his work: "The artist felt in his performance
the superiority of the <i>momentary inspiration</i> to all the rules and
shifts of mere technical scholarship." It explains the unevenness
of his work and its lack of finish. He had no patience to
return to a poem and labor upon it. Other and more rapturous
melodies were calling to him. It explains his lack of constructive
power: inspiration is a thing of rapturous glimpses, not of
long, patient coördinating effort. His poems are chaotic in structure
even to the point often of obscurity. "Corn," for example,
was intended to be a poem with a message, and that message
doubtless the superiority of corn over cotton as a crop for the
new South. But half the poem has only the vaguest connection
with the subject. One-third of it outlines the duties and privileges
of the poet soul. The message is not brought home: one has
to labor to find it. There is a succession of beautiful images expressed
often with rare melody and distinction, but inconsecutive
even to vagueness.</p>

<p>His prose has the same characteristics. The lectures on the
English novel seem like the first draft of work rather than like
a finished product. He changes his plan as he proceeds. It was
to be a study of the novel as a literary form, but as he progresses
he changes it into a study of the development of personality in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
literature, and finally ends it by devoting half his total space to
a rhapsody upon George Eliot. <i>The Science of English Verse</i> has
the same faults. He rides a pet theory through chapters and
dismisses really basic principles with a paragraph. It is a book
of magnificent, even at times of inspired sections, but as a complete
treatise it has no great value. The same may be said of
all his prose work: he had flashes of inspiration but no consecutive
message. The cause for it was partly pathological, partly temperamental.
He was first of all a musician, a genius, an improvisatore.</p>

<p>That his conception of the poet's office was a broader and saner
and more modern one than that of most of his contemporaries was
undoubtedly true. In "Corn" he addresses thus the stalk that
stands high above its fellows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Still shalt thou type the poet-soul sublime<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That leads the vanward of his timid time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sings up cowards with commanding rime&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soul calm, like thee, yet fain, like thee, to grow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By double increment, above, below;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soul homely, as thou art, yet rich in grace like thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Teaching the yeomen selfless chivalry.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">The poet then is not to be a mere dreamer of beauty, a dweller
in the clouds apart from the men of his time. He is to stand
squarely on the earth:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thou lift'st more stature than a mortal man's,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet ever piercest downward in the mold<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And keepest hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the reverend and steadfast earth<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That gave thee birth.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>But despite his conception of the poet's office, Lanier himself
is not often a leader and a prophet. He had ceased to be Georgia-minded
and he had felt the national thrill that was making a new
America, but it was not his to be the strong voice of the new era.
"The Psalm of the West," which casts into poetic form certain
vital episodes of American history, has no message. One searches
it in vain for any interpretation of the soul of the great republic,
or any forecasting of the future years, or any passages expressing
what America is to stand for among the nations. It is a fragment,
the introduction to what should have been the poem.</p>

<p>In "The Symphony" more than elsewhere, perhaps, he is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
poet of his period. The poem is a cry against the materialism
that Lanier felt was crushing the higher things out of American
life:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O Trade! O, Trade! Would thou wert dead!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Time needs heart&mdash;'t is tired of head:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We're all for love," the violins said.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">Each instrument in the orchestra joins in the argument. "A
velvet flute note" followed the passion of the violins, the reeds
whispered, "the bold straightforward horn" spoke out,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And then the hautboy played and smiled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sang like any large-eyed child.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">The solution of the problem was the same that Shelley had
brought. Love alone could master the evils of the time:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Life! Life! thou sea-fugue, writ from east to west,<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Love, love alone can pore<br /></span>
<span class="i12">On thy dissolving score<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Of harsh half-phrasings,<br /></span>
<span class="i14">Blotted ere writ,<br /></span>
<span class="i12">And double erasings<br /></span>
<span class="i14">Of chords most fit.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">And love was to come through music:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Music is love in search of a word.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">The poem is indeed a symphony. One feels that the poet is composing
rather than writing, that he is thinking in terms of orchestration,
balancing parts and instruments, and working out
tone values. The same is true of "The Marshes of Glynn" and
"Sunrise": they are symphonies.</p>

<p>One must appreciate fully this musical basis of Lanier's art if
one is to understand him. He thought in musical forms. The
best illustration, perhaps, may be found in his Centennial Cantata.
To the average man the poem meant little. One must read
it and reread it and study it if one is to get any consecutive
thought from it. But read after Lanier's explanation, it becomes
not only clear but illuminating:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The principal matter over which the United States can legitimately
exult is <i>its present existence as a Republic</i>, in spite of so much opposition
from Nature and from man. I therefore made the refrain of
the song&mdash;about which all its train of thought moves&mdash;concern itself
wholly with the <i>Fact of existence</i>: the waves cry "<i>It shall not be</i>"; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
powers of nature cry "It shall not <i>be</i>"; the wars, etc., utter the same
cry. This Refrain is the key to the whole poem.</p>

<p>A knowledge of the inability of music to represent any shades of
meaning save those which are very intense, and very highly and sharply
contrasted, led me to divide the poem into the eight paragraphs or
movements which it presents, and make these vividly opposed to each
other in sentiment. Thus the first movement is reflection, measured
and sober: this suddenly changes into the <i>agitato</i> of the second: this
agitato, culminating in the unison shout "<i>No! It shall not be</i>," yields
in the third movement to the <i>pianissimo</i> and meager effect of the
skeleton voices from Jamestown, etc.: this <i>pianissimo</i> in the fourth
movement is turned into a climax of the wars of armies and of faiths,
again ending in the shout, "No!" etc.: the fifth movement opposes this
with a <i>whispered</i> chorus&mdash;Huguenots whispering <i>Yea</i>, etc.: the sixth
opposes again with loud exultation, "Now praise," etc.: the seventh
opposes this with the single voice singing the Angels' song; and the
last concludes the series of contrasts with a broad full chorus of measured
and firm sentiment.</p>

<p>The metrical forms were selected purely with reference to their descriptive
nature: the four trochaic feet of the opening strophe measure
off reflection, the next (Mayflower) strophe swings and yaws like a
ship, the next I made outre and bizarre and bony simply by the device
of interposing the line of two and a half trochees amongst the four
trochee lines: the swift action of the Huguenot strophe of course required
dactyls: and having thus kept the first part of the poem (which
describes the time <i>before</i> we were a real nation) in meters which are
as it were exotic to our tongue, I now fall into the iambic meter&mdash;which
is the genius of English words&mdash;as soon as the Nation becomes
secure and firm.</p>

<p>My business as member of the orchestra for three years having
caused me to sit immediately in front of the bassoons, I had often been
struck with the possibility of producing the ghostly effects of that part
of the bassoon register so well known to students of Berlioz and Meyerbeer&mdash;by
the use of the syllable <i>ee</i> sung by a chorus. With this view
I filled the ghostly Jamestown stanza with <i>ee</i>'s and would have put
in more if I could have found them appropriate to the <span class="locked">sense.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">No one can read this without thinking of Poe's "Philosophy of
Composition." It explains much of Lanier's work.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Had Lanier lived a decade longer, had he had time and strength
to devote himself completely to his poetry, had his impetuous soul
had time to gain patience and poise, and divest itself of florid extravagance
and vague dithyramb, he might have gained a much
higher place as a poet. He was gaining in power: his last poem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
is his greatest. He was laying plans that would, we feel sure,
have worked themselves out to high poetic achievement. For at
least four books of poetry he had already selected titles: <i>Hymns
of the Mountains</i>, <i>Hymns of the Marshes</i>, <i>Songs of Aldheim</i>, and
<i>Poems on Agriculture</i>. What they were to be we can judge only
from "The Marshes of Glynn" and "Sunrise."</p>

<p>In these two poems we have work that is timeless and essentially
placeless. There is a breadth and sweep about it that one finds
only in the greater poets:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">And invisible wings, fast fleeting, fast fleeting,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Are beating<br /></span>
<span class="i6">The dark overhead as my heart beats&mdash;and steady and free<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Is the ebb-tide flowing from marsh to sea.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, what is abroad in the marsh and the terminal sea?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Somehow my soul seems suddenly free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the weighing of fate and the sad discussions of sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the length and the breadth and the sweep of the marshes of Glynn.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As the marsh-hen secretly builds on the watery sod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold I will build me a nest on the greatness of God:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will fly in the greatness of God as the marsh-hen flies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the freedom that fills all the space 'twixt the marsh and the skies:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By so many roots as the marsh-grass sends in the sod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will heartily lay me a-hold on the greatness of God:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, like the greatness of God is the greatness within<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The range of the marshes, the liberal marshes of Glynn.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">The jottings that he made in his notebooks and the fragments of
poems that he noted down as the inspiration came to him remind
us often of Whitman. They have sweep and range:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I fled in tears from the men's ungodly quarrel about God: I fled
in tears to the woods, and laid me down on the earth; then somewhat
like the beating of many hearts came up to me out of the ground, and
I looked and my cheek lay close by a violet; then my heart took courage
and I said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I know that thou art the word of God, dear violet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, oh, the ladder is not long that to my heaven leads!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Measure the space a violet stands above the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis no farther climbing that my soul and angels have to do than that!"<br /></span>
<span class="i8">I went to the church to find my Lord.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">They said He is here. He lives here.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">But I could not see him<br /></span>
<span class="i8">For the creed-tables and bonnet flowers.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
Lanier is essentially a poet of unfulfilled promise. He seems
always about to do greater things than in reality he ever does.
His lyrics like "Evening Song," and "The Trees and the
Master" and "The Song of the Chattahoochee," have strains in
them almost Shelley-like, but there is always the fatal defect somewhere.
Nothing is perfect. It seems strange sometimes that one
who could at moments go so far could not go the whole way and
remain long. He must hold his place among the American poets
by virtue of a few fragments. A few times was he rapt into the
pure ether of poetry, but he was allowed to catch only fleeting
glimpses.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>The period may be said to have produced in the South two inspired
poets, Lanier and Irwin Russell, and in many ways the two
were alike. Both were frail of body and sensitive of temperament,
both were passionately given to music and found their
poetic field by means of it, both were educated men, eager students
of the older literatures, both discovered the negro as poetic material,
and both died when their work was just beginning, Russell,
like Keats, at the boyish age of twenty-six. But Russell added
what Lanier had no trace of, a waywardness of character and a
genius for goodfellowship that wrecked him even earlier than it
did Burns.</p>

<p>The life of Russell is associated with four cities: Port Gibson,
Mississippi, where he was born in 1853; St. Louis, where he spent
the earlier years of his life and where later he completed the
course at the Jesuit University; Port Gibson again, where he
studied law and was admitted to the bar; New York City, of
which he was a resident from January until July, 1879; and New
Orleans, where he died in December of the same year. His life
was fitful and restless. He did little with his profession, turning
from it to learn the printer's trade, and then after a few listless
months, drifting into other things. He had dreams of California
and wandered on foot in its direction as far as Texas; he attempted
to run away to sea, and he spent much time on the river
boats making jovial friends of the captains and the pilots. His
banjo assured him of a welcome wherever he might go.</p>

<p>The writing of poetry was never to him a serious occupation.
He composed with abandon when the mood was on him, he seldom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
revised, and he cared little for the finished product save as it
might please his friends. One finds many evidences in his work
that he learned his art from Burns, whom he considered the greatest
poet the world had ever produced. He had saturated himself
too with the English balladists and the genuine old poets of the
early periods. The poetry of his own time angered him. In "The
Hysteriad" (<i>Scribner's</i>, 16:759) he satirizes with bitterness the
contemporary product. "A poem of the period," he said, "or a
periodical poem, is a thing that is altogether emotional, and is
not intended to convey any idea in particular." To him poetry
meant something not esoteric and idealized, but something that lay
very close to the life of every day, something redolent of humanity,
like Burns's songs. He maintained that his own inspiration
had come not at all from other poets, but from actual contact
with the material that he made use of. His own words concerning
the composition of his first poem have a peculiar value. They are
a part of the history of the period:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You know I am something of a banjoist. Well, one evening I was
sitting in our back yard in old Mississippi "twanging" on the banjo,
when I heard the missis&mdash;our colored domestic, an old darkey of the
Aunt Dinah pattern&mdash;singing one of the outlandish camp-meeting
hymns of which the race is so fond. She was an extremely "'ligious"
character and, although seized with the impulse to do so, I hesitated
to take up the tune and finish it. I did so, however, in the dialect I
have adopted, and which I then thought and still think is in strict conformity
to their use of it, I proceeded, as one inspired, to compose
verse after verse of the most absurd, extravagant, and, to her, irreverent
rime ever before invented, all the while accompanying it on the banjo
and imitating the fashion of the plantation negro.... I was then
about sixteen and as I had soon after a like inclination to versify, was
myself pleased with the performance, and it was accepted by a publisher,
I have continued to work the vein <span class="locked">indefinitely.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>To what extent the poet was indebted to the Pike balladry that
had preceded his first work, at least so far as wide publication in
Northern magazines was concerned, is not easily determined. It
seems extremely probable that he had seen it. Lanier, as has
been shown, had published negro dialect poetry in <i>Scribner's</i>
nearly a year before Russell, but whoever was pioneer, the author
of "Christmas-night in the Quarters" was the one who first
caught the attention of the reading public and exerted the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
influence upon the period. He undoubtedly was the leading
pioneer. Page and Gordon dedicated their <i>Befo' de War</i> "To
Irwin Russell, who awoke the first echo," and Joel Chandler
Harris, manifestly an authority, declared that "Irwin Russell
was among the first&mdash;if not the very first&mdash;of Southern writers to
appreciate the literary possibilities of the negro character, and
of the unique relations existing between the two races before the
war, and was among the first to develop <span class="locked">them."<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>In the last year of his life Russell, encouraged by the reception
of his magazine poems, went to New York to make literature his
profession. Bunner, the editor of <i>Puck</i>, and Gilder and Robert
Underwood Johnson of the <i>Century</i> staff, and others, recognized
his ability, and gave him every encouragement possible. One of
the most prominent of the poets of the older school, it may be
remarked, also became interested in him and urged him to drop
the ephemeral type of verse to which he had addicted himself and
devote his talents to really serious work. For a brief period he
obeyed, with what success one may judge from the poems at the
end of his volume.</p>

<p>Success came too late. His friends were powerless to control
his wayward genius. His frail constitution gave way. From a
bed of fever he arose still half delirious, staggered to the docks,
engaged to work his way on a New Orleans boat as a coal-heaver,
and in New Orleans secured a position on the <i>Times</i>. But the
end was near. To a member of the <i>Times</i> staff he opened his
heart in words that might have come from Poe:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It has been the romance of a weak young man threaded in with the
pure love of a mother, a beautiful girl who hoped to be my wife, and
friends who believed in my future. I have watched them lose heart,
lose faith, and again and again I have been so stung and startled that
I have resolved to save myself in spite of myself.... I never <span class="locked">shall.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">He died a few weeks later.</p>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>The value of Russell's work depends not so much upon the
poetic quality of it as upon the faithfulness and the skill with
which he has portrayed the negro. Within this narrow field he
has had no superior. Harris has summed it up thus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The most wonderful thing about the dialect poetry of Irwin Russell
is his accurate conception of the negro character. The dialect is not
always the best&mdash;it is often carelessly written&mdash;but the negro is there,
the old-fashioned, unadulterated negro, who is still dear to the Southern
heart. There is no straining after effect&mdash;indeed the poems produce
their result by indirection; but I do not know where could be found
to-day a happier or a more perfect representation of negro <span class="locked">character.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>Russell is less romantic in his picture of the negro than are
Page and Harris. Once in a while he throws the mellow light
over the old days, as in "Mahsr John," where he represents the
freed slave dwelling in imagination upon the glories that he has
once known, but he holds the strain not long:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I only has to shet my eyes, an' den it seems to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sees him right afore me now, jes' like he use' to be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A-settin' on de gal'ry, lookin' awful big an' wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wid little niggers fannin' him to keep away de flies.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He alluz wore de berry bes' ob planters' linen suits,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' kep' a nigger busy jes' a-blackin' ob his boots;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">De buckles on his galluses wuz made of solid gol',<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' diamon's!&mdash;dey wuz in his shut as thick as it would hol'.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">Page would have stopped after the old negro had ended his glorification
of the old days, but Russell hastens to bring the picture to
present-day conditions:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Well, times is changed. De war it come an' sot de niggers free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' now ol' Mahsr John ain't hardly wuf as much as me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had to pay his debts, an' so his lan' is mos'ly gone&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' I declar' I's sorry fur my pore ol' Mahsr John.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">It was essentially the later negro, the negro of the poet's own day,
that is represented in the poems. He has become a farmer for
himself now and tries sly tricks when he takes his cotton to
market. Detected, he is voluble in his explanations:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Rocks in dat ar cotton! How de debbil kin dat be?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I packed dat bale mys'f&mdash;hol' on a minute, le'&mdash;me&mdash;see&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My stars! I mus' be crazy! Mahsr Johnny, dis is fine!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I's gone an' hauled my brudder's cotton in, stead ob mine!<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">He sends his boy to work as waiter on the river boats and as he
is departing overwhelms him with advice:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span></p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dem niggers what runs on de ribber is mos'ly a mighty sharp set;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dey'd fin' out some way fur to beat you, ef you bet 'em de water wuz wet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You's got to watch out for dem fellers; dey'd cheat off de horns ob a cow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I knows 'em; I follered de ribber 'fore ebber I follered a plow.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">He is inordinately fond of preaching, as witness "Half-way
Doin's" and "A Sermon for the Sisters." He delights to interpret
the Scriptures, and his exegesis is often full of local color:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Dar's gwine to be a' oberflow," said Noah, lookin' solemn&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fur Noah tuk the <i>Herald</i>, an' he read de ribber column&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' so he sot his hands to wuk a-cl'arin' timber-patches,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' 'lowed he's gwine to build a boat to beat the steamah <i>Natchez</i>.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">All the characteristics of the negro are touched upon with the
certainty of perfect knowledge: his superstitions, his ignorance
of the world, his awe of legal terms, his humor, his simple trust
in his religion, his childlike attitude toward nature, his habit of
addressing sententious language to his beasts of burden as if they
understood all he said, his conceit, and his firm belief in immortality.</p>

<p>Russell was one of the pioneers of the new era which had as its
most marked characteristic the use of American themes and backgrounds
and absolute truth to American life. No section of the
social era was too lowly or unknown for him to take as material
for his art. He could even plan to write a negro novel with all
of its characters negroes and write the first chapters. Little,
however, that he planned ever came to completion. The thin
volume of poems published after his death was but a fragment of
what he might have written under happier conditions. As it is,
he must, like Lanier, be treated as one of those brief excited lives
that are found ever at the opening of new romantic eras&mdash;Novalis,
Chatterton, Burns, Keats&mdash;poets who left behind only fragments
of what might have been, but who influenced enormously the
writers that were to be.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE ERA OF SOUTHERN THEMES AND WRITERS</span></h2>

<p>Just as the West of Mark Twain, Harte, Miller, Eggleston,
and others had been central in the literature, especially in the
fiction, of the seventies, so the South became central in the
eighties. Southern writers like Cable, Lanier, and Russell began
their distinctive work not long after the opening of the Bret
Harte period, yet it was not until after <i>Old Creole Days</i>, 1879,
the death of Russell in the same year and of Lanier in 1881,
and the publication of Miss Woolson's <i>Rodman the Keeper</i> and
the first Uncle Remus book in 1880, Johnston's <i>Dukesborough
Tales</i>, 1883, and Craddock's <i>In the Tennessee Mountains</i>, 1884,
that what we may call the era of Southern themes and Southern
writers may be said fully to have taken possession of American
literature. By 1888 Albion W. Tourgee could write in the
<i>Forum</i>, "It cannot be denied that American fiction of to-day,
whatever may be its origin, is predominatingly Southern in type
and character.... A foreigner studying our current literature,
without knowledge of our history, and judging our civilization
by our fiction, would undoubtedly conclude that the South was
the seat of intellectual empire in America and the African the
chief romantic element of our population."</p>

<p>The real cause of this outburst has not often been touched
upon. The sudden vogue of Southern themes and Southern
writers came not, as some have explained, from the fact that a
distinctive Southern literature had arisen, or that a peculiar
school had sprung up in one section of the country, just as, for
instance, we may speak of the New England school earlier in
the century. Nor is it explained by the theory that the close
of the war brought a new feeling of individuality to the South,
a consciousness of its own self which was to find expression in
a group of writers, as England after the wars with Spain found expression
in the Elizabethans. It was not a merely local manifestation.
The term "Southern Literature," as now found in the titles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
of an increasing number of books and studies, is misleading. If
the South, or any other section, is to produce a distinct literature
of its own, that section must possess not alone themes and writers,
but publishers as well, and widely circulated magazines of the
type of the <i>Atlantic</i> and the <i>Century</i> and <i>Harper's</i>. It must
have also critics and adequate critical standards, and, most important
of all, it must have a clientele, readers enough to dispose
of its own literary product. The South has had practically none
of these save the literary themes and the writers. The turn of
the tide from Western material and Western workers to material
and workers from the South was a national phenomenon. It
was in reality more a thing of the North than it was of the South.
Without Northern publishers and magazines and criticism and
readers there would have been no Southern literature.</p>

<p>To illustrate with a concrete example: Richard Malcolm
Johnston published at Augusta, Georgia, in 1864, <i>Georgia
Sketches by an Old Man</i>. In 1871 he added more tales to the
collection, published them in the <i>Southern Magazine</i> of Baltimore,
issued them in book form in the same city, with the title
<i>Dukesborough Tales</i>, and a little later put forth a second and
enlarged edition. Yet Edward Eggleston could say when Johnston
as late as 1879 published his first story in a Northern magazine,
"Mr. Neelus Peeler's Conditions," in <i>Scribner's Monthly</i>,
that the reading public everywhere hailed his advent as that of a
new and promising young man who had sent in his first story.
It was not until the Harpers in 1883 issued a Northern edition
of the much-published <i>Dukesborough Tales</i> that Johnston ceased
to be a producer of merely Southern literature.</p>

<p>The cause of the Southern tone which American literature took
on during the eighties lies in the single fact that the South had
the literary material. The California gold, rich as it was when
first discovered by the East, was quickly exhausted. There were
no deep mines; it was surface gold, pockets and startling nuggets.
Suddenly it was discovered that the South was a field
infinitely richer, and the tide turned. Nowhere else were to be
found such a variety of picturesque types of humanity: negroes,
crackers, creoles, mountaineers, moonshiners, and all those incongruous
elements that had resulted from the great social upheaval
of 1861&ndash;1865. Behind it in an increasingly romantic
perspective lay the old régime destroyed by the war; nearer was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
the war itself, most heroic of struggles; and still nearer was the
tragedy of reconstruction with its carpet-bagger, its freed slaves,
and its Klu-Klux terror. Never before in America, even in California,
had there been such richness of literary material. That
a group of Southern-born writers should have arisen to deal with
it was inevitable. Who else <i>could</i> have dealt with it, especially
in the new era that demanded reality and absolute genuineness?
No Northerner could have revealed, for instance, the heart of
the old plantation negro. Miss Woolson's stories of the South,
brilliant as they are, are in a different world from those of Joel
Chandler Harris.</p>

<p>The writers themselves made no claim that they were producing
a Southern literature. They had, all of them, been touched
by the new after-the-war spirit, and their outlook was nation
wide. Cable in an address at Oxford, Mississippi, in June, 1882,
pleaded for home subjects as a basis for literature, but for home
subjects treated in a spirit of the broadest nationality: "Only
let them be written," he urged, "to and for the whole nation and
you shall put your own State not the less but the more in your
<span class="locked">debt."<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></span> He declared himself to be not at all in favor of the
popular new phrase "the new South"; he would change it, he
said, to "the <i>no</i> South." Lanier, as we have seen, was American
in the broadest sense, and Joel Chandler Harris could say:
"What does it matter whether I am a Northerner or Southerner if
I am true to truth and true to that larger truth, my own true
self? My idea is that truth is more important than sectionalism
and that literature that can be labeled Northern, Southern, Western,
Eastern, is not worth <span class="locked">labeling."<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the voice of the new spirit of the new age.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>That the enormous vogue of the Bret Harte and the <i>Pike
County Ballads</i> literature of the early seventies could have passed
unnoticed even in the remotest sections of America seems improbable,
but to attempt to trace the influence it exerted on the
group of Southern writers that sprang up shortly after it had
made its appearance is useless and worse than useless. Not for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
moment must it be forgotten that this earlier Western outburst
was not a local evolution that succeeded in attracting the attention
of the nation; it was rather the first result of a condition
which was general and nation wide. It was the new after-the-war
demand for life and reality and democracy, and it broke out
first in the West because the West at that moment had material
which was peculiarly fitted to make an appeal. Had the West at
that crisis had no writers ready to exploit this material, the outburst
undoubtedly would have come from the South. Cable and
Lanier and Johnston and Russell would have written very much
as they did write had Bret Harte and Mark Twain and Edward
Eggleston never lived.</p>

<p>There were influences and conditions in the South that were
peculiarly favorable to the production of the type of literature
demanded by the time. Georgia in particular offered congenial
soil. The middle region of the State was the most democratic
part of the South. It had been settled by a sturdy race which
separation from the more aristocratic areas had rendered
peculiarly individual. At one extreme was the mountain
cracker, a type which had been made peculiar only by isolation,
at the other were such remarkable men as Alexander H. Stephens,
Atticus G. Haygood, Benjamin H. Hill, John B. Gordon, and
Henry W. Grady. The social system was peculiar. Relations
between master and slave were far different from those found
on the larger plantations where overseers were employed. The
negroes were known personally; they were a part of the family.
Relations like those described so delightfully by Joel Chandler
Harris were common. "There was no selling," as Johnston expressed
it; "black and white children grew up together. Servants
descended from father to son." The result of this democracy
was a natural tendency toward the new realistic type
of localized literature. While the rest of the South had been
romantic and little inclined to use its own backgrounds and its
own local types of character, Georgia had been producing since
the mid years of the century studies of its own peculiar types
and institutions.</p>

<p>As early as 1835 had appeared <i>Georgia Scenes, Characters,
Incidents, etc., in the First Half Century of the Republic. By
a Native Georgian</i>, from the pen of Augustus B. Longstreet,
graduate of Yale, lawyer, preacher, college president. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
republished in New York in 1840 and from that day it has never
been out of print. A realistic, brutal series of sketches it is, full
of ear-chewing fights, cruel gougings, horse-racings, horse-swaps,
coarse practical jokes, and all the barbarous diversions of a
primitive people in a primitive time. Its author apologizes in
his preface for the ephemeral character of the book: the stories
and sketches, he explains, are "nothing more than fanciful combinations
of real incidents and characters." Yet few books of
its decade have had more vitality. The author worked first hand
in the materials of the life that he himself had seen about him.
It is true at every point. Its author, a generation ahead of
his times, summed up in one phrase the new realism that was
to come: "real people and real incidents in fanciful combinations."</p>

<p>Associated with Longstreet in this earlier realistic period of
Georgia were Oliver Hillhouse Prince (1787&ndash;1837), who contributed
to <i>Georgia Scenes</i> "The Militia Drill," a sketch read
perhaps by Thomas Hardy before he wrote his <i>Trumpet-Major</i>,
and William Tappan Thompson (1812&ndash;1882), whose <i>Major
Jones's Chronicles</i> appeared in book form in Philadelphia in
1840.</p>

<p>There was another element in Georgia during the earlier
period which had strong influence upon the later group of
writers, and allowed it to produce not only Richard Malcolm
Johnston and Joel Chandler Harris and "Bill Arp," but poets
like Ticknor and Lanier as well. In the cities and larger towns
of the State there was an atmosphere of culture unique in the
South. Harry Stillwell Edwards would account for it by calling
attention to an element usually overlooked:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the late thirties&mdash;1839 to be exact&mdash;Wesleyan Female College
came into being at Macon&mdash;the first chartered college for women in
the world, and soon began to turn out large classes of highly educated
and accomplished graduates. The majority of these came from
Georgia, but the whole South has always been represented in Wesleyan.
Without going into this subject, I wish to state as my personal opinion
that Georgia's literary development, which is undoubtedly more extensive
than that of other Southern States, is due to the intellectual and
spiritual soil or environment produced by this College in the fifty years
of its existence previous to 1890. You will understand how this can be
true though the mothers of the State's best known writers may not have
been graduates. In my youth, every girl associate I had was of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
college. Its atmosphere was everywhere apparent. To-day its graduates
lead all over the <span class="locked">State.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>One may trace these elements&mdash;the Longstreet realism at the
one extreme and the Macon College influence at the other&mdash;in all
the later Georgia writers. We have found how Lanier in his
earlier work alternated between broad cracker sketches and
dialect ballads and the more elegant forms of prose and poetry.
Even a poem as rhapsodic as his "Corn" contains within it a
realistic picture of the thriftless Georgia planter. It was from
the blending of these two streams of influence that there came
some of the strongest literature of the new period.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The link between Longstreet and the younger Georgia writers
is to be found in Richard Malcolm Johnston. Chronologically&mdash;he
was born in 1822&mdash;he belongs to the earlier group, the generation
of Lowell and Story, Boker and Read and Edward
Everett Hale, and he seems to have been touched not at all by
the literary influences that had so strongly exerted themselves
upon the writers of the seventies. He was reared on a central
Georgia plantation with all the surroundings of the old régime;
he had been educated in the type of rural school so graphically
described in his earlier sketches and then later at Mercer College,
from which he was graduated in 1841; he gave the vigorous
years of his life to the law and then to teaching; and after he
was sixty years of age began seriously to devote himself to the
profession of literature.</p>

<p>As early as 1857 he had begun writing sketches of provincial
life after the Longstreet pattern. His first piece, "The Goose
Pond School" was followed at long intervals by others in the
same vein, written, the greater part of them, after his removal to
Baltimore partly to assist his friend Turnbull, the editor of
the <i>Southern Magazine</i>, who had asked for his help, and partly
"to subdue as far as possible the feeling of homesickness for my
native region. It never occurred to me that they were of any
sort of value. Yet when a collection of them, nine in all, was
printed by Mr. Turnbull, who about that time ended publication
of his magazine, and when a copy of this collection fell into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
hands of Henry M. Alden, of <i>Harper's Magazine</i>, whose acquaintance
I had lately made, he expressed much surprise that I had
not received any pecuniary compensation, and added that he
would have readily accepted them if they had been offered to
him. Several things he said about them that surprised and
gratified me much. I then set into the pursuit of that kind of
<span class="locked">work."<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Johnston owed his introduction to Northern readers almost
wholly to Lanier, who also was an exile in Baltimore. His influence
it was that induced Gilder to accept for <i>Scribner's
Monthly</i> the first of the <i>Dukesborough Tales</i> to be published in
the North. He did far more than this: he gave him constructive
criticism; he pointed out to him weaknesses which might be
tolerated in a pioneer like Longstreet, but not in the work of a
later artist. Certain phases of his sketches he found exceedingly
strong: "The story strikes me as exquisitely funny, and your
reproduction of the modes of thought and of speech among the
rural Georgians is really <span class="locked">wonderful."<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></span> There were, however,
frequent "verbal lapses" which were almost fatal, "the action
of the story does not move fast enough," and the catastrophe is
clumsily handled. "I will try to see you in a day or two and
do this" [read the manuscript aloud to him with running
criticisms]. It was an opportunity that few authors ever get;
and Johnston was wise enough to make the fullest use of it.
Through Lanier it was that Alden became acquainted with his
work and that the enlarged <i>Dukesborough Tales</i> was taken over
by the Harpers, and it was only after the Northern issue of this
book in 1883 that its author took a place among the writers of
the period. During the following fifteen years he wrote voluminously.</p>

<p>Lanier's criticism touches with skill the strength and the weakness
of Johnston as a writer of fiction. Like Longstreet, he was
preëminently a maker of sketches. In his novels like <i>Old Mark
Langston</i> and <i>Widow Guthrie</i> he failed dismally. Local color
there is and humor and characterization, but in all that pertains
to plot management the novels are feeble. The center and soul
of his art was the Georgia environment. "As long as the people
in my stories have no fixed surroundings, they are nowhere to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
me; I cannot get along with them at all." There is little of
story, little of action, little consideration of the deeper passions
and motives of life: there is rather an artless presentation of
the archaic provincial types and surroundings that he had known
in his boyhood. Even within this restricted area his range
was narrow. He seemed to be attracted, as was Longstreet,
by the eccentric and the exceptional. As he looked back into his
earlier years it was only the highly individualized characters
and surroundings that stood out in his memory, and he peopled
his stories largely with these. Like Lincoln he had traveled a
primitive legal circuit in primitive days and he had had unique
experiences highly laughable. His range of characters also is
small. There is little of the negro in his work: he deals almost
wholly with the class of middle Georgia common people that are
but one step removed from the mountain cracker of Harris and
Harbin.</p>

<p>Johnston was to the Southern movement what Eggleston was to
the Western. The two have many points of resemblance. Both
were humorists, both worked in the crude materials of early
American life, and both seem to have evolved their methods and
their literary ideals very largely from themselves. Neither was
an artist. They will live largely because of their fidelity to a
vanished area of American life.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Joel Chandler Harris also continued the tradition of Longstreet
and worked in the materials of Georgia life with little
suggestion from without. There are few instances of a more
spontaneous lapsing into literary expression. He had been reared
in an environment as unliterary as Mark Twain's. Longstreet
and Johnston, Russell and Lanier, were all college men, but
Harris's school education ended when he was twelve, and the
episode that ended it, a most unusual one, he has described thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>One day while Joe Maxwell was sitting in the post-office looking over
the Milledgeville papers, his eye fell on an advertisement that interested
him greatly. It seemed to bring the whole world nearer to him. The
advertisement set forth the fact that on next Tuesday the first number
of the <i>Countryman</i>, a weekly paper, would be published. It would be
modeled after Mr. Addison's little paper, the <i>Spectator</i>, Mr. Goldsmith's
little paper, the <i>Bee</i>, and Mr. Johnson's little paper, the <i>Ram</i>-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span><i>bler</i>.
It would be edited by J.&nbsp;A. Turner, and it would be issued on
the plantation of the editor, nine miles from Hillsborough. Joe read
this advertisement over a dozen times, and it was with a great deal of
impatience that he waited for the next Tuesday to come.</p>

<p>But the day did come, and with it came the first issue of the <i>Countryman</i>.
Joe read it from beginning to end, advertisements and all, and
he thought it the most entertaining little paper he had ever seen.
Among the interesting things was an announcement by the editor that
he wanted a boy to learn the printing business. Joe borrowed pen and
ink and some paper from the friendly postmaster, and wrote a letter to
the editor, saying that he would be glad to learn the printing business.
The letter was no doubt an awkward one, but it served its purpose, for
when the editor of the <i>Countryman</i> came to Hillsborough he hunted
Joe up, and told him to get ready to go to the plantation....</p>

<p>[The office] was a very small affair; the type was old and worn, and
the hand-press&mdash;a Washington No. 2&mdash;had seen considerable service....
He quickly mastered the boxes of the printer's case, and before
many days was able to set type swiftly enough to be of considerable help
to Mr. Snelson, who was foreman, compositor, and pressman. The
one queer feature about the <i>Countryman</i> was the fact that it was the
only plantation newspaper that has ever been published, the nearest
post-office being nine miles away. It might be supposed that such a
newspaper would be a failure; but the <i>Countryman</i> was a success from
the start, and at one time it reached a circulation of nearly two thousand
copies. The editor was a very original writer.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>On the Plantation: a Story of a Georgia Boy's Adventures
during the War</i> is the record, slightly disguised&mdash;Joe Maxwell
is Joe Harris, and Hillsborough is Eatonton&mdash;of the four years
in the boy's life that made of him the Joel Chandler Harris that
we know to-day. It was his college course, and it was a marvelously
complete one. He became a part of the great plantation;
he shared its rude festivities; he came closely in contact
with the old-time type of plantation negro; and, more important
still, he discovered his employer's great library and was
directed in his reading by Mrs. Turner, who took pains with
the diffident young lad. In time he became himself a contributor
to the paper, secretly at first, then openly with the editor's approval.
The end of the war and with it the end of the old
plantation régime, ended also the <i>Countryman</i> and sent Harris
into wider fields.</p>

<p>For a time he worked at Macon, home of Lanier, then at New
Orleans, where Cable in the intervals of office work was dreaming
over the old French and Spanish records, then for a time he
was editor of the Forsyth, Georgia, <i>Advertiser</i>. The force and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
originality of his editorials attracted at length the attention of
W.&nbsp;T. Thompson, author of the Georgia classic, <i>Major Jones's
Courtship</i>, and in 1871 he secured him for his own paper, the
<i>Savannah News</i>. Five years later, Harris went over to the <i>Atlanta
Constitution</i> and during the twenty-five years that followed
his life was a vital part of that journal's history.</p>

<p>One must approach the literary work of Harris always with
full realization that he was first of all a journalist. During the
greater part of his life he gave the best of every day unreservedly
to the making of his paper. Literary fame came to him almost
by accident. To fill the inexorable columns of his paper he threw
in what came easiest for him to write and he thought no more
about it. Then one day he looked up from his desk to find himself
hailed as a rising man of letters. It amazed him; he never
half believed it; he never got accustomed to it. Years later in
the full noon of his success he could say: "People insist on considering
me a literary man when I am a journalist and nothing
else. I have no literary training and know nothing at all of
what is termed literary art. I have had no opportunity to
nourish any serious literary ambition, and the probability is that
if such an opportunity had presented itself I would have refused
to take advantage of it." Never once did he seek for publication;
never once did he send a manuscript to any publisher or
magazine that had not earnestly begged for it; never once did
he write a line with merely literary intent.</p>

<p>His first recognition by the literary world came through a
bit of mere journalism. The story is told best in the words of
Harry Stillwell Edwards:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>About 1880, Sam Small of Atlanta, Georgia, on the local staff of the
<i>Constitution</i>, began writing negro sketches, using "Old Si" or "Uncle
Si" as his vehicle, and soon made the character famous. Small, however,
was very dissipated, and frequently the Sunday morning Old Si
contribution failed to appear. Joel Chandler Harris, the paragrapher
for the <i>Constitution</i> as he had been for the <i>Savannah News</i>, was called
on to supply something in place of the missing Si sketches and began
with "Uncle Remus." His first contributions were not folk lore, but
local. He soon drifted into the folk lore, however, and recognizing the
beauty and perfection of his work, people generally who remembered
the stories of their childhood, wrote out for him the main points and
sent them. I, myself, contributed probably a dozen of the adventures of
Brer Rabbit as I had heard them. This service he afterwards acknowledged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
in a graceful card of thanks. Uncle Remus became, soon, the
mouthpiece of the generation, so far as animal legends are concerned.</p></blockquote>

<p>The stories at once attracted attention in the North. The
<i>New York Evening Post</i> and the <i>Springfield Republican</i> in particular
made much of them. As a direct result, <i>Uncle Remus:
His Songs and Sayings; The Folk-lore of the old Plantation</i>,
appeared in 1880 and its author quickly found himself a national
and indeed an international personage.</p>

<p>The really vital work of Harris lies in two fields: sketches of
the old-time negro and sketches of the mountain cracker of the
later period. It is upon the first that his permanence as a
writer must depend. He worked in negro folk lore, in that vast
field of animal stories which seems to be a part of the childhood
of races, but it is not his folk lore, valuable as it may be, that
gives him distinction. Ethnological and philological societies
have done the work more scientifically. Many of the animal
legends in common use among the slaves of the South were already
in print before he began to <span class="locked">write.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></span> What he did was to
paint a picture, minutely accurate, of the negro whom he had
known intimately on the plantation of Mr. Turner at the transition
moment when the old was passing into the new. With a
thousand almost imperceptible touches he has made a picture
that is complete and that is alive. The childish ignorance of
the race and yet its subtle cunning, its quaint humor, its pathos,
its philosophy, its conceit, its mendacity and yet its depth of
character, its quickness at repartee&mdash;nothing has been omitted.
The story teller is more valuable than his story: he is recording
unconsciously to himself his own soul and the soul of his race.
Brer Rabbit after all is but a negro in thinnest disguise, one does
not have to see Frost's marvelous drawings to realize that.
The rabbit's helplessness typifies the helplessness of the negro,
and yet Brer Rabbit always wins. Suavity and duplicity and
shifty tricks are the only defense the weak may have. His
ruses are the ruses of a childlike mind. Clumsy in the extreme
and founded on what seems like the absolute stupidity of Brer
Fox and Brer Wolf and the others who are beguiled, these ruses
always succeed. The helpless little creature is surrounded on
all sides by brutality and superior force; they seemingly overcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
him, but in the end they are defeated and always by force
of superior cunning and skilful mendacity at the supreme moment.
It is the very essence of the child story&mdash;the giant killed
by Jack, the wolf powerless to overcome Little Red Riding Hood,
and all the others&mdash;for the negro himself was but a child.</p>

<p>Page uses the negro as an accessory. The pathos of the black
race adds pathos to the story of the destroyed white régime.
Harris rose superior to Page in that he made the negro not the
background for a white aristocracy, but a living creature valuable
for himself alone; and he rose superior to Russell inasmuch
as he embodied the result of his studies not in a type but in a
single negro personality to which he gave the breath of life.
Harris's negro is the type plus the personal equation of an individual&mdash;Uncle
Remus, one of the few original characters which
America has added to the world's gallery.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note too that he interpreted with the same
patience and thoroughness the music and the poetry of the negro.
Russell was a lyrist with the gift of intuition and improvisation;
Harris was a deliberate recorder. The songs he wrote are not
literary adaptations, nor are they framed after the conventional
minstrel pattern. They are reproductions. In his first introduction
to <i>Uncle Remus, His Songs and His Sayings</i> he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>As to the songs, the reader is warned that it will be found difficult
to make them conform to the ordinary rules of versification, nor is it
intended that they should so conform. They are written, and are intended
to be read, solely in reference to the regular invariable recurrence
of the cæsura, as, for instance, the first stanza of the Revival
Hymn:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, whar | shill we go | w'en de great | day comes |<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wid de blow | in' er de trumpits | en de bang | in' er de drums |<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hoy man | y po' sin | ers 'll be kotch'd | out late |<br /></span>
<span class="i0">En fine | no latch | ter de gold | en gate |<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>In other words, the songs depend for their melody and rhythm upon
the musical quality of <i>time</i>, and not upon long or short, accented or
unaccented, syllables. I am persuaded that this fact led Mr. Sidney
Lanier, who is thoroughly familiar with the metrical peculiarities of
negro songs, into the exhaustive investigation which has resulted in the
publication of his scholarly treatise on The Science of English Verse.</p></blockquote>

<p>Nowhere else does one come so completely into the feeling of
negro music as in Harris. In "The Night Before Christmas,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
in <i>Nights with Uncle Remus</i>, a latter-day "Sir Roger de Coverley
Paper," we feel the tone of it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>His voice was strong and powerful, and sweet, and its range was as
astonishing as its volume. More than this, the melody to which he
tuned it, and which was caught up by a hundred voices almost as sweet
and as powerful as his own, was charged with a mysterious and pathetic
tenderness. The fine company of men and women at the big house&mdash;men
and women who had made the tour of all the capitals of Europe&mdash;listened
with swelling hearts and with tears in their eyes as the song
rose and fell upon the air&mdash;at one moment a tempest of melody, at
another a heart-breaking strain breathed softly and sweetly to the gentle
winds. The song that the little boy and the fine company heard was
something like this&mdash;ridiculous enough when put in cold type, but
powerful and thrilling when joined to the melody with which the
negroes had invested it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">De big Owl holler en cry fer his mate,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">My honey, my love!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, don't stay long! oh, don't stay late!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">My honey, my love!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hit ain't so mighty fur ter de good-by gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">My honey, my love!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whar we all got ter go w'en we sing out de night,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">My honey, my love!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My honey, my love, my heart's delight&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">My honey, my love!<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>With the success of the first Uncle Remus book there came the
greatest flood of dialect literature that America has ever known.
The years 1883 and 1884 mark the high tide of this peculiar outbreak,
and to Georgia more than to any other locality may be
traced the primal cause. In 1883 came what may be called the
resurgence of the cracker, that Southeastern variety of the
Pike which now came to the North as a new discovery. The
leading characteristics of the type were thus set forth by Harris
in his story of "Mingo":</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Slow in manner and speech, shiftless in appearance, hospitable but
suspicious toward strangers, unprogressive, toughly enduring the poor,
hard conditions of their lives, and oppressed with the melancholy
silences of the vast, shaggy mountain solitudes among which they dwell.
The women are lank, sallow, dirty. They rub snuff, smoke pipes&mdash;even
the young girls&mdash;and are great at the frying pan; full of a complaining
patience and a sullen fidelity.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
Again America became excited over a new Pike County type.
Johnston's <i>Dukesborough Tales</i> were issued for the first time
in the North; Harris's "At Teague Poteet's, a Sketch of the
Hog Mountain Range," appeared in the June <i>Century</i>, and
Charles Egbert Craddock's story of the same mountains, "The
Harnt that Walks Chilhowee," came out the same month in the
<i>Atlantic</i>. That was in 1883. The next year appeared Harris's
<i>Mingo</i>, and Craddock's <i>In the Tennessee Mountains</i>. Then the
flood gates of dialect were loosened. The <i>Century</i> published
Page's story "Mars Chan," which it had been holding for four
years, a story told entirely in the negro dialect. The new and
mysterious Craddock, who was found now to be Miss Mary N.
Murfree, created a widespread sensation. In 1883 appeared
James Whitcomb Riley's first book <i>The Old Swimmin'-Hole and
'Leven More Poems</i> and Mary Hallock Foote's <i>The Led-Horse
Claim</i>; in 1887 came Octave Thanet's <i>Knitters in the Sun</i>,
dialect tales of the Arkansas canebrakes, and shortly afterwards
Hamlin Garland's studies of farm life in the middle West.
The eighties stand for the complete triumph of dialect and of
local color.</p>

<p>Henry James, viewing the phenomenon from his English standpoint,
offered an explanation that is worthy of note: "Nothing
is more striking," he wrote, "than the invasive part played
by the element of dialect in the subject-matter of the American
fictions of the day. Nothing like it, probably&mdash;nothing like any
such predominance&mdash;exists in English, in French, in German
work of the same order. It is a part, in its way, to all appearance,
of the great general wave of curiosity on the subject
of the soul aboundingly <i>not</i> civilized that has lately begun
to well over the Anglo-Saxon globe and that has borne Mr. Rudyard
Kipling, say, so supremely high on its crest."</p>

<p>Harris's work with the Georgia cracker, though small in
quantity, is of permanent value. Unlike Craddock, he was upon
his native ground and he worked with sympathy. He had not
the artistic distinction and the ideality of Page, but he was able
to bring his reader nearer to the material in which he worked.
Page was romantic and his standpoint was essentially aristocratic;
Harris was realistic and democratic. He worked close always to
the fundamentals of human life and his creations have always
the seeming spontaneousness of nature itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
As a writer Harris must be summed up as being essentially
fragmentary. His literary output was the work of a man who
could write only in the odd moments stolen from an exacting
profession. It is work done by snatches. He left no long masterpiece;
his novels like <i>Gabriel Tolliver</i> and the rest are full of
delightful fragments, but they are rambling and incoherent.
Of <i>Plantation Pageants</i> its author himself could say, "Glancing
back over its pages, it seems to be but a patchwork of memories
and fancies, a confused dream of old times." With his Brer
Rabbit sketches, however, this criticism does not hold. By their
very nature they are fragmentary; there was no call for continued
effort or for constructive power; the only demand was
for a consistent personality that should emerge from the final
collection and dominate it, and this demand he met to the
full.</p>

<p>No summary of Harris's work can be better than his own comment
once uttered upon <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>: "It is history, it
is romance, it is life. Here we behold a human character stripped
of all tiresome details; we see people growing and living; we
laugh at their humor, share their griefs, and, in the midst of it
all, behold we are taught the lesson of honesty, justice, and
mercy." To no one could this verdict apply more conspicuously
than to the creator of Uncle Remus and of Teague Poteet.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>To the Georgia group belongs in reality Mary Noailles Murfree,
better known as Charles Egbert Craddock. Tennessee, her
native State&mdash;she was born at Murfreesboro in 1850&mdash;was of
Georgia settlement. On one side of the border as on the other
one found a certain wild independence and originality and crude
democracy, the same that voiced itself in Longstreet and Thompson,
and later in Johnston and Harris. Moreover, the mountains
of the Craddock tales lie along the Georgia border and
their inhabitants are the same people who figured in Longstreet's
"Gander Pulling" and furnished Gorm Smallin and Teague
Poteet for Lanier and Harris.</p>

<p>During the seventeen years of her later childhood and youth,
or from 1856 to 1873, Miss Murfree lived at Nashville, Tennessee,
where her father had an extensive legal practice, and then until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
1882 she made her home at St. Louis, Missouri. She was, therefore,
unlike Johnston and Harris, metropolitan in training and
in point of view. Lameness and a certain frailness of physique
caused by a fever debarred her from the activities of childhood
and drove her in upon herself for entertainment. She was precocious
and she read enormously, pursuing her studies even into
the French and the Italian. Later she attended the academy at
Nashville and then a seminary at Philadelphia, and, on her return
home, even began the study of law in her father's library.</p>

<p>For such a woman, especially in the seventies, literature as a
profession was inevitable. She began to write early and some of
her apprentice papers, signed even then with the pen name
Charles E. Craddock, found publication, notably a few sketches
and tales in the weekly <i>Appleton's Journal</i>. It was conventional
work and it promised little. Between a sketch like "Taking the
Blue Ribbon at the Fair" and "The Dancin' Party at Harrison's
Cove," which appeared in the May issue of the <i>Atlantic</i>, 1878,
there is a gulf that even yet has not been fully explained. Undoubtedly
the early models that influenced her were George
Eliot, Thomas Hardy, and Bret Harte, but she has preserved little
of her transition work. She came unheralded with her art
fully matured. Whoever may have been her early masters, she
was from the first autochthonic in style and material and in the
atmosphere that she threw over all that she wrote. There was a
newness to her work, a tang of the wild and elemental in the
dialect, a convincing quality to the backgrounds painted in
sentences like "An early moon was riding, clear and full, over
this wild spur of the Alleghanies," that excited wide comment.
It was not until 1884, however, that the new author may be
said definitely to have arrived, for it was not until then that her
stories were given the dignity of book form.</p>

<p>With the publication of <i>In the Tennessee Mountains</i> came one
of the most dramatic happenings that ever gave wings to a new
book. Charles Egbert Craddock visited the <i>Atlantic</i> office and,
to the amazement of Aldrich and Howells and Dr. Holmes, he
was a woman. The sensation, coming as it did from the center
of the old New England tradition, gave the book at once an international
fame and made Charles Egbert Craddock a name as
widely known as Dr. Holmes. She followed her early success
with a long series of Tennessee mountain novels. Six of them&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span><i>The
Prophet of the Great Smoky Mountains</i>, <i>In the Clouds</i>, <i>The
Despot of Broomsedge Cove</i>, <i>His Vanished Star</i>, <i>The Mystery of
Witchface Mountain</i>, and <i>The Juggler</i>&mdash;first appeared serially in
the Atlantic, and, for a time at least, it seemed as if her work had
taken its place among the American classics.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Criticism of the Craddock novels must begin always with the
statement that their author was not a native of the region with
which she dealt. She had been born into an old Southern family
with wealth and traditions, and she had been reared in a city
amid culture and a Southern social régime. The Tennessee mountains
she knew only as a summer visitor may know them. For
fifteen summers she went to the little mountain town of Beersheba,
prototype undoubtedly of the "New Helvetia Springs" of her
novels, and from there made excursions into the wilder regions.
She saw the mountains with the eyes of the city vacationist:
she was impressed with their wildness, their summer moods with
light and shadow, their loneliness and their remote spurs and
coves and ragged gaps. She saw them with the picture sense
of the artist and she described them with a wealth of coloring
that reminds one of Ruskin. In every chapter, often many times
repeated, gorgeous paintings like these:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A subtle amethystine mist had gradually overlaid the slopes of the
T'other Mounting, mellowing the brilliant tints of the variegated foliage
to a delicious hazy sheen of mosaics; but about the base the air
seemed dun-colored, though transparent; seen through it, even the red
of the crowded trees was but a somber sort of magnificence, and the
great masses of gray rocks, jutting out among them here and there,
wore a darkly frowning aspect. Along the summit there was a blaze
of scarlet and gold in the full glory of the sunshine; the topmost cliffs
caught its rays, and gave them back in unexpected gleams of green or
grayish-yellow, as of mosses, or vines, or huckleberry bushes, nourished
in the heart of the deep fissures.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>Mink, trotting along the red clay road, came suddenly upon the banks
of the Scolacutta River, riotous with the late floods, fringed with the
papaw and the ivy bush. Beyond its steely glint he could see the
sun-flooded summit of Chilhowee, a bronze green, above the intermediate
ranges: behind him was the Great Smoky, all unfamiliar viewed
from an unaccustomed standpoint, massive, solemn, of dusky hue; white
and amber clouds were slowly settling on the bald. There had been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
shower among the mountains, and a great rainbow, showing now only
green and rose and yellow, threw a splendid slant of translucent color
on the purple slope. In such an environment the little rickety wooden
mill&mdash;with its dilapidated leaking race, with its motionless wheel moss-grown,
with its tottering supports throbbing in the rush of the water
which rose around them, with a loitering dozen or more mountaineers
about the door&mdash;might seem a feeble expression of humanity. To Mink
the scene was the acme of excitement and interest.</p></blockquote>

<p>A picture of summer it is for the most part painted lavishly
with adjectives, and presented with impressionistic rather than
realistic effect. Every detail is intensified. The mountains of
eastern Tennessee are only moderate ridges, yet in the Craddock
tales they take on the proportions of the Canadian Rockies or the
Alps. The peak that dominates <i>In the Clouds</i> seems to soar like
a Mont Blanc:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the semblance of the cumulus-cloud from which it takes its name,
charged with the portent of the storm, the massive peak of Thunderhead
towers preëminent among the summits of the Great Smoky Mountains,
unique, impressive, most subtly significant. What strange attraction
of the earth laid hold on this vagrant cloud-form? What unexplained
permanence of destiny solidified it and fixed it forever in
the foundations of the range? Kindred thunderheads of the air lift
above the horizon, lure, loiter, lean on its shoulder with similitudes and
contrasts. Then with all the buoyant liberties of cloudage they rise&mdash;rise!...
Sometimes it was purple against the azure heavens; or gray
and sharp of outline on faint green spaces of the sky; or misty, immaterial,
beset with clouds, as if the clans had gathered to claim the
changeling.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Always the scenery dominates the book. It is significant that all
of her early titles have in them the name of a locality,&mdash;the setting
is the chief thing: Lost Creek, Big Injun Mounting, Harrison's
Cove, Chilhowee, the Great Smoky Mountains, Broomsedge
Cove, Keedon Bluffs. In stories like <i>The Mystery of
Witch-Face Mountain</i> the background becomes supreme: the
human element seems to have been added afterwards by a sort
of necessity; the central character is the great witch-face on
the mountain.</p>

<p>It reminds one of Hardy, and then one remembers that when
"The Dancin' Party at Harrison's Cove" appeared in the
<i>Atlantic</i>, <i>The Return of the Native</i> had for three months been
running as a serial in <i>Harper's Monthly</i>, and that, somewhat
later, <i>In the "Stranger-People's" Country</i> and <i>Wessex Folk</i> ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
for months parallel in the same magazine. It is impossible not
to think of Hardy as one reads <i>Where the Battle Was Fought</i>,
1884. The battle-field dominates the book as completely as does
Egdon Heath <i>The Return of the Native</i>, and it dominates it in
the same symbolic way:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>By wintry daylight the battle-field is still more ghastly. Gray with
the pallid crab-grass which so eagerly usurps the place of the last summer's
crops, it stretches out on every side to meet the bending sky.
The armies that successively encamped upon it did not leave a tree for
miles, but here and there thickets have sprung up since the war, and
bare and black they intensify the gloom of the landscape. The turf in
these segregated spots is never turned. Beneath the branches are rows
of empty, yawning graves, where the bodies of soldiers were temporarily
buried. Here, most often, their spirits walk, and no hire can induce
the hardiest plowman to break the ground. Thus the owner of the land
is fain to concede these acres to his ghostly tenants, who pay no rent.
A great brick house, dismantled and desolate, rises starkly above the dismantled
desolation of the plain.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The title of the book&mdash;<i>Where the Battle Was Fought</i>&mdash;makes the
battle-field central in the tragedy, and so it is with the short
stories "'Way Down in Lonesome Cove" and "Drifting Down
Lost Creek." Nature is always cognizant of the human tragedy
enacted before it and always makes itself felt. In <i>The Juggler</i>,
Tubal Cain Sims believes that murder has been done:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He sighed an' groaned like suthin' in agony. An' then he says, so
painful, 'But the one who lives&mdash;oh, what can I do&mdash;the one who
lives!'" He paused abruptly to mark the petrified astonishment on
the group of faces growing white in the closing dusk.</p>

<p>An owl began to hoot in the bosky recesses far up the slope. At the
sound, carrying far in the twilight stillness, a hound bayed from
the door of the little cabin in the Cove, by the river. A light, stellular
in the gloom that hung about the lower levels, suddenly sprung up in
the window. A tremulous elongated reflection shimmered in the shallows.</p></blockquote>

<p>But such effects in her work are fitful: one feels them strongly
at times, then forgets them in the long stretches of dialect conversation
and description seemingly introduced for its own sake.
Of the art that could make of Egdon Heath a constantly felt,
implacable, malignant presence that harried and compelled its
dwellers until the reader at last must shake himself awake as
from a nightmare, of this she knew little. She worked by means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
of brilliant sketches; she relied upon her picturing power to
carry the story, and as a result the effect is scattered.</p>

<p>In her characterization she had all the defects of Scott: she
worked largely with externals. She had an eye for groups posed
artistically against a picturesque background as in that marvelous
opening picture in "'Way Down on Lonesome Cove."
She expended the greatest of care on costume, features, habits
of carriage and posture, tricks of expression, individual oddities,
but she seldom went deeper. We see her characters distinctly;
not often do we feel them. In her major personages, like the
Prophet, the Despot, the Juggler, we have little sympathetic interest,
and it is impossible to believe that they were much more
than picturesque specimens even to the author herself. To get
upon the heart of the reader a character must first have been
upon the heart of his creator. Here and there undoubtedly she
did feel the thrill of comprehension as she created, a few times
so keenly indeed that she could forget her art, her note book,
and her audience. The one thing that seems to have touched
her heart as she journeyed through the summer valleys and into
the remote coves seems to have been the pitiful loneliness and
heart-hunger of the women. Could she have done for all of
her characters what she did for Celia Shaw and Madeline and
Dorinda and a few other feminine souls, the final verdict upon
her work might have been far different from what it must be now.</p>

<p>Her stories necessarily are woven from scanty materials. In
the tale of a scattered and primitive mountain community there
can be little complication of plot. The movement of the story
must be slow, as slow indeed as the round of life in the coves
and the lonesome valleys. But in her long-drawn narratives
often there is no movement at all. She elaborates details with
tediousness and records interminable conversations, and breaks
the thread to insert whole chapters of description, as in Chapter
VI of <i>The Juggler</i>, which records the doings at a mountain revival
meeting seemingly for the mere sake of the local color.
Nearly all of her longer novels lack in constructive power. Like
Harte, whom in so many ways she resembled, she could deal
strongly with picturesque moments and people, but she lacked
the ability to trace the growth of character or the slow transforming
power of a passion or an ideal or a sin.</p>

<p>Her style was peculiarly her own; in this she was strong. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
worthy of note that in an age rendered styleless by the newspaper
and the public school she was able to be individual to the
extent that one may identify any page of her writings by the
style alone. It is not always admirable: there is a Southern
floridness about it, a fondness for stately epithet that one does
not find in Harris or in others of the Georgia group. She can
write that the search light made "a rayonnant halo in the dim
glooms of the riparian midnight," and she can follow the jocose
observation of a woman washing dishes with this tremendous
sentence: "'What fur?' demanded the lord of the house, whose
sense of humor was too blunted by his speculations, and a haunting
anxiety, and a troublous eagerness to discuss the question of
his discovery, to perceive aught of the ludicrous in the lightsome
metaphor with which his weighty spouse had characterized her
dissatisfaction with the ordering of events." It may be interesting
to know that the woman vouchsafed no reply. Rather, "she
wheezed one more line of her matutinal hymn in a dolorous
cadence and with breathy interstices between the spondees."</p>

<p>She is at her best when describing some lonely valley among
the ridges, or the moonlight as it plays fitfully over some scene
of mountain lawlessness, or some remote cabin "deep among the
wooded spurs." In such work she creates an atmosphere all her
own. Few other writers have so made landscape felt. One may
choose illustrations almost at random:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>On a certain steep and savage slope of the Great Smoky Mountains,
the primeval wilderness for many miles is unbroken save for one meager
clearing.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>Deep among the wooded spurs Lonesome Cove nestles, sequestered
from the world. Naught emigrates from thence except an importunate
stream that forces its way through a rocky gap, and so to freedom beyond.
No stranger intrudes; only the moon looks in once in a while.
The roaring wind may explore its solitudes; and it is but the vertical
sun that strikes to the heart of the little basin, because of the massive
mountains that wall it round and serve to isolate it.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>The night wind rose. The stars all seemed to have burst from their
moorings and were wildly adrift in the sky. There was a broken
tumult of billowy clouds, and the moon tossed hopelessly among them,
a lunar wreck, sometimes on her beam ends, sometimes half submerged,
once more gallantly struggling to the surface, and again sunk. The
bare boughs of the trees beat together in a dirgelike monotone.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
Nowhere is she commonplace; nowhere does she come down
from the stately plane that she reaches always with her opening
paragraph. Even her dialect is individual. Doubtless other
writers have handled the mountain speech more correctly, doubtless
there is as much of Charles Egbert Craddock in the curious
forms and perversions as there is of the Tennessee mountaineers,
yet no one has ever used dialect more convincingly than she or
more effectively. She has made it a part of her style.</p>

<p>The story of Charles Egbert Craddock is a story of gradual
decline. <i>In the Tennessee Mountains</i> was received with a universality
of approval comparable only with that accorded to
<i>The Luck of Roaring Camp</i>. In her second venture, <i>Where
the Battle Was Fought</i>, she attempted to break from the narrow
limits of her first success and to write a Hardy-like novel of the
section of Southern life in which she herself belonged, but it
failed. From all sides came the demand that she return again
to her own peculiar domain. And she returned with <i>The Prophet
of the Great Smoky Mountains</i>. It was praised, but with the
praise came a note of dissatisfaction, a note that became more
and more dominant with every novel that followed. Her first
short stories had appealed because of their freshness and the
strangeness of their setting. Moreover, since they were the first
work of a young writer they were a promise of better things to
come. But the promise was not fulfilled. After <i>The Juggler</i>,
her last attempt on a large scale to create a great Tennessee-mountains
novel, she took the advice of many of her critics and
left the narrow field that she had cultivated so carefully. She
wrote historical romances and novels of contemporary life, but
the freshness of her early work was gone. After 1897 she
produced nothing that had not been done better by other
writers.</p>

<p>Her failure came not, as many have believed, from the poverty
of her materials and the narrowness of her field. Thomas
Hardy deliberately had chosen for his novels a region and a
people just as primitive. A great novel should concern itself
with the common fundamentals of humanity, and these fundamentals,
he believed, may be studied with more of accuracy in
the isolated places where the conventions of polite society have
not prevented natural expression. Or, to quote Hardy's own
words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Social environment operates upon character in a way that is oftener
than not prejudicial to vigorous portraiture by making the exteriors of
men their screen rather than their index, as with untutored mankind.
Contrasts are disguised by the crust of conventionality, picturesqueness
obliterated, and a subjective system of description necessitated for the
differentiation of character. In the one case the author's word has to
be taken as to the nerves and muscles of his figures; in the other they
can be seen as in an écorché.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The failure of Charles Egbert Craddock came rather from
her inability to work with large masses of material and coördinate
it and shape it into a culminating force. She was picturesque
rather than penetrating, melodramatic rather than simple, a
showman rather than a discerning interpreter of the inner meanings
of life. She could make vivid sketches of a moment or of
a group or a landscape, but she could not build up touch by
touch a consistent and compelling human character. Her genius
was fitted to express itself in the short story and the sketch, and
she devoted the golden years of her productive life to the making
of elaborate novels. A little story like "'Way Down on Lonesome
Cove" is worth the whole of the <i>The Juggler</i> or <i>In the
Clouds</i>. The short stories with which she won her first fame
must stand as her highest achievement.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Later members of the Georgia group, Sarah Barnwell Elliott,
Harry Stillwell Edwards, and William Nathaniel Harben, have
continued the tradition of Longstreet and have dealt more or
less realistically with the humbler life of their region. Miss
Elliott with her <i>The Durket Sperrit</i> entered the domain of
Charles Egbert Craddock and gave a new version of the mountain
dialect. A comparison of this novel with <i>The Juggler</i>,
which appeared the same year, is illuminating. The two writers
seem to be complements of each other, the one strong where the
other is weak. The story lacks the atmosphere, the poetic dignity,
the sense of mystery and of mountain majesty so notable
in the elder novelist, but it surpasses her in characterization and
in sympathy. The people are tremendously alive. The tyrannical
old woman about whom the tale centers, with her narrow
ideals and her haughty "Durket sperrit," dominates every page<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
as Egdon Heath dominates <i>The Return of the Native</i>. She is
felt during every moment of the story and so is the pathetic
little mountain waif in the earlier chapters of <i>Jerry</i>. Miss
Elliott's distinctive work is limited to these two books. Had
she had the courage to work out with clearness the central
tragedy of <i>The Durket Sperrit</i>, the deliberate disgracing of
Hannah by her discarded lover, the book might take its place
among the few great novels of the period.</p>

<p>Edwards inclined more toward the old Georgia type of human-nature
sketch. His best work is to be found in his short
studies in black and white after the Johnston pattern. Indeed,
his first story, "Elder Brown's Backslide," <i>Harper's Monthly</i>,
1885, without his name would have been regarded as a Dukesborough
Tale. He has written two novels, one of which, <i>Sons and
Fathers</i>, was awarded the $10,000 prize offered by the <i>Chicago
Record</i> for a mystery story, but he is not a novelist. He is humorous
and picturesque and often he is for a moment the master
of pathos, but he has added nothing new and nothing commandingly
distinctive.</p>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Constance Fenimore Woolson's <i>Rodman the Keeper</i>, 1880, undoubtedly
was a strong force in the new Southern revival. During
the eighties Miss Woolson was regarded as the most promising
of the younger writers. She was a grand niece of Cooper,
a fact made much of, and she had written short stories of unusual
brilliance, her collection, <i>Castle Nowhere</i>, indeed, ranking as a
pioneer book in a new field. Again was she destined to be a
pioneer. In 1873 the frail health of her mother sent her into
the South and for six years she made her home in Florida, spending
her summers in the mountains of North Carolina, Virginia,
South Carolina, and Georgia. During the rest of her life her
stories were studies of Southern life and Southern conditions.
Only <i>Anne</i> of her novels and two late collections of Italian tales
may be noted as exceptions.</p>

<p>It was in <i>Rodman the Keeper</i>, a collection of her magazine
stories of the late seventies, that the North found its first adequate
picture of the territory over which had been fought the
Civil War. The Tourgee novels, which had created a real sensation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
were political documents, but here were studies carefully
wrought by one who did not take sides. It showed the desolation
wrought by the armies during the four years, the pathos of
broken homes and ruined plantations, the rankling bitterness,
especially in the hearts of women, the helpless pride of the survivors,
and the curious differences between the Northern and
the Southern temperaments. It was careful work. Contemporary
opinion seemed to be voiced by the Boston <i>Literary
World</i>: The stories "more thoroughly represent the South than
anything of the kind that has been written since the war."</p>

<p>Necessarily the standpoint was that of an observer from without.
There was no dialect in the tales, there were no revealings
of the heart of Southern life as in Harris and Page and the others
who had arisen from the material they used, but there was beauty
and pathos and a careful realism that carried conviction. A
sketch like "Felipe," for example, is a prose idyl, "Up the Blue
Ridge" is the Craddock region seen with Northern eyes, and the
story that gives the title to the book catches the spirit of the defeated
South as few writers not Southern born have ever done.</p>

<p>For a time Miss Woolson held a commanding place among
the novelists of the period. After her untimely death in 1894
Stedman wrote that she "was one of the leading women in the
American literature of the century," and again, "No woman
of rarer personal qualities, or with more decided gifts as a
novelist, figured in her own generation of American writers."
But time has not sustained this contemporary verdict. Her ambitious
novel <i>Anne</i>, over which she toiled for three years, brilliant
as it may be in parts, has not held its place. And her short
stories, rare though they may have been in the day of their newness,
are not to be compared with the perfect art of such later
writers as Miss King and Mrs. Chopin. She must take her place
as one of the pioneers of the period who discovered a field and
prepared an audience for writers who were to follow.</p>

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>The appearance of Page's <i>In Ole Virginia</i>, 1887, marks the
culmination of the period of Southern themes. The sensation
caused by <i>The Quick or the Dead?</i> by Amélie Rives (later
Princess Troubetzkoy) in 1888 need only be referred to. It had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
little significance either local or otherwise. The younger writers,
born for the most part at a later date, like John Fox, Jr., Mary
Johnston, and Ellen Glasgow, belong to another period.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE LATER POETS</span></h2>

<p>Although prose forms, especially the novel and the short
story, dominated the period, yet the amount of poetry published
from 1860 to 1899 surpasses, in mere bulk at least, all that had
been produced in America before that date. In quality also it
is notable. Stedman's <i>An American Anthology</i> has 773 pages
of selections, and of this space 462 pages, or almost two-thirds,
are given to the poets who made their first appearance during
these forty years. Very many whom he mentions were only incidentally
poets. A surprising number of those who are known
to-day only as novelists or short story writers began their career
with a volume and in some cases with several volumes of verse.
Few indeed have been the writers who have not contributed
poetical material. Among the poets are to be numbered writers
as inseparably connected with prose as Thoreau, Burroughs,
Howells, Mrs. Stuart Phelps Ward, S. Weir Mitchell, Miss
Woolson, Lew Wallace, Mrs. Wilkins Freeman, Harris, Page, Mrs.
Cooke, Ambrose Bierce, Alice Brown, Hamlin Garland, and A.&nbsp;S.
Hardy.</p>

<p>Those who may be counted as the distinctive poets of the era,
the third generation of poets in America, make not a long list
if only those be taken who have done new and distinctive work.
Not many names need be added to the following twenty-five whose
first significant collections were published during the twenty

<h3>I</h3>

<p>For the greater part these later poets were children of the new
era who with Whitman voiced their own hearts and looked at the
life close about them with their own eyes. The more individual
of them, the leading innovators who most impressed themselves
upon their times&mdash;Whitman, Hay and Harte, Miller, Lanier and
Russell&mdash;we have already considered. They rose above conventions
and rules and looked only at life; they stood for the
new Americanism of the period, and they had the courage that
dared in a critical and fastidious age to break away into what
seemed like crude and unpoetic regions. Not many of them could
go to the extremes of Whitman, or even of Harte and Hay. Some
would voice the new message of the times in the old key and the
old forms; others would adopt the new fashions but change not at
all the old themes and the old sentiments.</p>

<p>Of the latter class Will Carleton perhaps is the typical representative.
By birth and training he belonged to the Western
group of innovators represented by Mark Twain and Eggleston
and Miller. He had been born in a log cabin in Michigan and
he had spent all of his boyhood on a small, secluded farm. He
had broken from his environment at twenty, had gained a college
degree, and following the lead of his inclination had become a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
journalist, first in Detroit, then in Chicago, Boston, and New
York. From journalism, especially in the seventies, it was but a
step to literature. He would be a poet, and led by the spirit of
his period he turned for material to the homely life of his boyhood.
He would make no realistic picture&mdash;no man was ever less
fitted than he to reproduce the external features of a scene or a
region&mdash;he would touch the sentiments and the emotions. "Betsey
and I Are Out," published in the <i>Toledo Blade</i> in 1871, was
the beginning. Then in 1873 came <i>Farm Ballads</i>, with such popular
favorites as "Over the Hills to the Poor-House" and "Gone
with a Handsomer Man," a thin book that sold forty thousand
copies in eighteen months. No poet since Longfellow had so appealed
to the common people. At his death in 1912 there had
been sold of his various collections more than six hundred thousand
copies.</p>

<p>His poetry as we read it to-day has in it little of distinction;
it is crude, for the most part, and conventional. It made its appeal
largely because of its kindly sympathy, its homeliness, and
its lavish sentiment. The poet played upon the chords of memory
and home and childhood, the message of the earlier Longfellow
cast into a heavily stressed and swinging melody that found a
prepared audience. With E.&nbsp;P. Roe, his counterpart in prose,
Will Carleton is largely responsible for prolonging the age of
sentiment.</p>

<p>A singer of a different type was John James Piatt, born in
Indiana in 1835 and joint author with W.&nbsp;D. Howells of <i>Poems of
Two Friends</i>, 1859. He was a classicist who caught the new
vision and sought to compromise. Everywhere in his work a
blending of the new and the old: the Western spirit that would
voice the new notes of the Wabash rather than echo the old music
of the Thames, that syren melody that had been the undoing of
Taylor and Stoddard. In an early review of Stedman, Piatt
had found, as he characteristically termed it, "a too frequent betrayal
of Tennyson's floating musk in his singing-garments," and
he had noted as his chief strength that "his representative subjects
are <span class="locked">American."<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></span> In making the criticism he touched upon
his own weakness and his own strength. In all his volumes conventional
work like "Rose and Root," "The Sunshine of
Shadows," and "The Unheard" alternates with more original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
poems, native in theme and to a degree native in spirit, like "The
Mower in Ohio," "The Pioneer's Chimney," "Fires in Illinois,"
and "Riding to Vote." There is no dialect, no straining for
realistic effect, no sentimentality. In all that makes for art the
poems have little for criticism: they are classical and finished
and beautiful. But they lack life. There is nothing about them
that grips the reader's heart, nothing that fixes itself in the
memory, no single line that has distinction of phrase. Even in
the Western poems like "The Mower in Ohio" there is no sharpness,
no atmosphere, no feeling of reality. It is art rather than
life; it is a conscious effort to make a poem. The case is typical.
With the criticism one may sweep away once for all great areas
of the poetry of the time.</p>

<p>Far stronger are the vigorous lyrics of Maurice Thompson,
whose work is to be found in so many literary fields of the period.
His poetry, small in quantity, has a spirit of its own that is distinctive.
It is tonic with the out-of-doors and it is masculine.
One stanza from the poem "At Lincoln's Grave," delivered before
the Phi Beta Kappa at Harvard in 1893, voices the new
Western soul:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His humor, born of virile opulence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stung like a pungent sap or wild-fruit zest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And satisfied a universal sense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of manliness, the strongest and the best;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A soft Kentucky strain was in his voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Ohio's deeper boom was there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With some wild accents of old Wabash days,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And winds of Illinois;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when he spoke he took us unaware,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his high courage and unselfish ways.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The successor of Carleton is James Whitcomb Riley of Indiana,
the leading producer during the later period of platform
and newspaper balladry. The early life of Riley was urban
rather than rural. His father was a lawyer at Greenfield, a
typical Western county seat, and after sending the boy to the village
school he sought to turn him to his own profession. But
there was a stratum of the wayward and the unconventional in
Riley even from the first. The professions and the ordinary occupations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
open to youth did not appeal to the imaginative lad.
He learned the trade of sign-painting and then for a year
traveled with a patent medicine "doctor" as advertising agent.
Following this picturesque experience came three or four years
as a traveling entertainer with a congenial troupe, then desultory
newspaper work, and finally, from 1877 to 1885, a steady position
on the Indianapolis <i>Journal</i>. His recognition as a poet came
in the mid eighties, and following it came a long period on the
lecture circuit, reading his own productions, at one time working
in conjunction with Eugene Field and Edgar W. Nye,&mdash;"Bill
Nye."</p>

<p>His earliest work seems to have been declamatory and journalistic
in origin. "I was always trying to write of the kind of
people I knew and especially to write verse that I could read just
as if it were being spoken for the first time." And again, "I
always took naturally to anything <span class="locked">theatrical."<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></span> For years the
newspaper was his only medium. He contributed to most of the
Indiana journals with pseudonyms ranging all the way from
"Edyrn" to "Jay Whitt" and "Benjamin F. Johnson of
Boone," and it was while writing under the last of these for
the Indianapolis <i>Journal</i> that he first became known beyond the
confines of Indiana. The device of printing poems that ostensibly
were contributed by a crude farmer from a back country
was not particularly original. Lowell had used it and Artemus
Ward. Moreover, the fiction of accompanying these poems with
editorial comment and specimen letters from the author was as
old at least as <i>The Biglow Papers</i>, but there was a Western, Pike
County freshness about the Benjamin F. Johnson material. The
first poem in the series, for instance, was accompanied by material
like this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. Johnson thoughtfully informs us that he is "no edjucated man,"
but that he has, "from childhood up tel old enugh to vote, allus wrote
more or less poetry, as many of an albun in the neghborhood can
testify." Again, he says that he writes "from the hart out"; and there
is a touch of genuine pathos in the frank avowal, "Thare is times when
I write the tears rolls down my cheeks."</p></blockquote>

<p>The poems that followed,&mdash;"Thoughts fer the Discuraged
Farmer," "When the Frost is on the Punkin," "Wortermelon
Time," and the others&mdash;were written primarily as humorous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
exercises just as Browne had written his first Artemus Ward contributions.
There is a histrionic element about them that must
not be overlooked. The author is playing a part. Riley, we
know, had, at least in his youth, very little sympathy with farm
life and very little knowledge of it: he was simply impersonating
an ignorant old farmer. The dialect does not ring true. There
never has been a time, for instance, when "ministratin'" for
ministering, "familiously" for familiarly, "resignated" for resigned,
and "when the army broke out" for when the war broke
out, have been used in Indiana save by those with whom they are
individual peculiarities. He is simply reporting the ignorance of
one old man in the Artemus Ward fashion. Dialect with him
is the record of a town man's mimicry of country crudeness. It
is conventional rather than realistic. It is a humorous device
like A. Ward's cacography. The first Johnson annotation will
illustrate:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Benj. F. Johnson, of Boone County, who considers the <i>Journal</i> a
"very valubul" newspaper, writes to inclose us an original poem, desiring
that we kindly accept it for publication, as "many neghbors
and friends is astin' him to have the same struck off."</p></blockquote>

<p>He issued the series at his own expense in 1883 with the title
<i>The Old Swimmin'-Hole and 'Leven More Poems by Benj. F.
Johnson, of Boone</i>, and he continued the masquerade until after
the publication of <i>Afterwhiles</i> in 1887. After the great vogue of
this later volume he began to publish voluminously until his
final collected edition numbered fourteen volumes.</p>

<p>Riley not only inherited Will Carleton's public entire, but he
added to it very considerably. He too dealt freely in sentiment
and he too wrote always with vocal interpretation in mind. Undoubtedly
the wide vogue of his poems has come largely from
this element. People have always enjoyed hearing the poems
read with an appropriate acting out of the part more than they
have enjoyed reading them for themselves. The poems, more
over, appeared in what may be called the old homestead period
in America. Denman Thompson first brought out his <i>Joshua
Whitcomb</i> in 1875 and his <i>The Old Homestead</i> in 1886. Riley
found a public doubly prepared. He revived old memories&mdash;the
word "old" is almost a mannerism with him: "The Old
Swimmin'-Hole," "Old Fashioned Roses," "The Old Hay-Mow,"
"The Old Trundle Bed," "Out to Old Aunt Mary's," "The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
Boys of the Old Glee Club," "An Old Sweetheart of Mine," etc.
Especially did he appeal to those whose childhood had been
spent in the country.</p>

<p>Finally, he added to Carleton's devices a metrical facility and
a jigging melody that is perhaps his most original contribution
to the period. More than any one else Riley is responsible for
the modern newspaper type of ballad that is to poetry what ragtime
is to music. There is a fatal facility to such a melody as,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

</div>
</div></div>

<p>In his preference for native themes and homely, unliterary
treatment of seemingly unpoetic material he continued the work
of the Pike County balladists. As the <i>Nation</i>, reviewing his <i>Old
Fashioned Roses</i>, expressed it, he finds pleasure in "some of the
coarser California flavors." His own standards for poetry he has
given clearly, and they are in full accord with the spirit of the
period:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span></p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<span class="i0">As sayin' is,&mdash;"We, Us and Company!"<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>But one cannot be sure of him. He is an entertainer, an actor,
a mimicker. Does his material really come "from the hart out"
or is he giving, what one always suspects, only excellent vaudeville?
Even in his most pathetic moments we catch for an instant,
or we feel that we do, a glimpse of the suave face of the
platform entertainer.</p>

<p>Once in a while his childhood lyrics ring true. A little note
of true pathos like this from <i>Poems Here at Home</i> is worth a
library of <i>The Flying Islands of the Night</i> and of his other
voluminous echoes of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let me come in where you sit weeping,&mdash;aye,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But ah! so sadder than yourselves am I,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Who have no child to die.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>Despite his enormous vogue, Riley must be dismissed as artificial
and, on the whole, insincere. He seems always to be striving
for effect&mdash;he is an entertainer who knows his audience
and who is never for a moment dull. He has little of insight,
little knowledge of the deeps of life and the human soul, little
of message, and he wrote enormously too much. He must be
rated finally as a comedian, a sentimentalist, an entertainer.</p>

<p>His influence has been great. A whole school of imitators has
sprung up about him, the most of whom have perished with the
papers to which they have contributed. The strongest of them
all undoubtedly was Sam Walter Foss (1858&ndash;1911) whose <i>Back
Country Poems</i> were genuine and distinctive. Drummond's
<i>Habitant</i> ballads, which rank with the strongest dialect poetry
of the century, belong to Canadian rather than American
literature. Stedman's praise of them is none too high: "Most
of us are content if we sing an old thing in a new way, or a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
thing in an old way. Dr. Drummond has achieved the truest
of lyrical successes; that of singing new songs, and in a new
way. His poems are idyls as true as those of Theocritus or
Burns or our own poet of <i>The Biglow Papers</i>."<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Greatly different from Riley, yet greatly like him in many
ways, was Eugene Field, in whom the lawlessness of the West
and the culture of the East met in strange confusion. Though
of Western origin&mdash;he was born at St. Louis in 1850&mdash;he spent
the formative years of his life between six and nineteen with
his father's relatives at Amherst, Massachusetts. He completed
a year at Williams College, then, called West by the death of his
father, whose law practice at St. Louis had been distinctive, he
was put by his guardian into Knox College. After a year he
was transferred to the University of Missouri, but coming of
age at the close of his junior year, and his share of his father's
estate becoming available, he decided in the spring of 1872 to
leave college and travel in Europe. Accordingly, to quote his
own words, he spent "six months and [his] patrimony in France,
Italy, Ireland, and England."</p>

<p>As a general rule one should quote the autobiographical statements
of Eugene Field with extreme caution, but one can trust
this bit of his "Auto-analysis":</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In May, 1873, I became a reporter on the St. Louis <i>Evening Journal</i>.
In October of that year I married Miss Julia Sutherland Comstock of
St. Joseph, Mo., at that time a girl of sixteen. We have had eight
children&mdash;three daughters and five sons.</p>

<p>My newspaper connections have been as follows: 1875-76, city editor
of the St. Joseph (Mo.) <i>Gazette</i>; 1876-80, editorial writer on the
St. Louis <i>Journal</i> and St. Louis <i>Times-Journal</i>; 1880-81, managing
editor of the Kansas City Times; 1881-83, managing editor of the Denver
<i>Tribune</i>. Since 1883 I have been a contributor to the Chicago
Record (formerly <i>Morning News</i>).<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>His success with the Denver <i>Tribune</i>, to which he contributed
such widely copied work as that published in his first thin volume,
<i>The Tribune Primer</i> (1882), attracted attention. He began
to receive offers from Eastern papers, one at least from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
Dana, editor of the New York <i>Sun</i>, but it was not until Melville
E. Stone offered him the humorous column of his paper, the
Chicago <i>News</i>, that Field decided to turn eastward. He had
begun to dream of a literary career and this dream, always a
vague one, for he was chained by poverty to a tyrannical profession,
seemed more possible in a less tense atmosphere than
that of the Western mining center. Arriving at Chicago in 1883,
he set out to make his new column a thing with distinction.
<i>Flats and Sharps</i> was the name he gave it, and into it he poured
a mélange of all things: poetry in every key, paragraphs on all
subjects, parodies, hoaxes, mock reviews, pseudo news, personals,
jokes&mdash;everything. He threw himself completely into the thing:
it became his life work; "practically everything he ever wrote
appeared at one time or another in that column."</p>

<p>But newspaper humor usually perishes with the flimsy leaves
upon which it is recorded. Not until Field had written "Little
Boy Blue" in 1887 did he become at all known to the reading
public. The publication of the popular editions of <i>A Little
Book of Profitable Tales</i> and <i>A Little Book of Western Verse</i> in
1890, only five years before his death, marks, perhaps, the time
of his general acceptation as a writer. Hardly had the public
learned to know him before they were called upon to mourn his
early death. Indeed, the work by which he is now best known
was done almost all of it in the last six or seven years of his life.
It was only in this brief later period that he was a "bibliomaniac"
or a lover of Horace or a student of the old English
ballads.</p>

<p>One must classify Eugene Field first of all as a humorist, one
of the leading figures in that nondescript school of newspaper
comedians that has played such a part in the history of the
period. To a personality as high spirited and as whimsical as
Artemus Ward's he added the brilliancy of a Locker-Lampson
and the improvidence of a Goldsmith as well as the kindly heart.
Seriousness seemed foreign to his nature: his life was a perpetual
series of hoaxes and practical jokes and hilarious sallies. No one
has surpassed him in the making of parodies, of rollicking paraphrases
and adaptations, in skilful blendings of modern and
antique, in clever minglings of seriousness and humor. He was
a maker of brilliant trifles and sparkling <i>non sequiturs</i>. His
irreverence is really startling at times. He can make the <i>Odes</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
of Horace seem fit material for the funny column of a Chicago
daily newspaper:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Boy, I detest the Persian pomp;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I hate those linden-bark devices;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">They can't be got at living prices!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Myrtle is good enough for us,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For <i>you</i>, as bearer of my flagon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For <i>me</i>, supine beneath this vine,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Doing my best to get a jag on!<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">He is boon companion of the old Sabine poet. He slaps him on
the back and invites him to all kinds of costly revelry, assuring
him that Mæcenas will pay the freight. And Horace by no
means takes offense. He is a congenial soul.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<span class="i4">As well as rime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For you've been there yourself, Mæcenas!<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>In the presence of such an incorrigible joker the reader feels
always that he must be on his guard. One is never safe. Leafing
the pages of the large collected edition of the poems, glancing
over the Bret Harte echoes like "Casey's Table D'Hôte,"
smiling at such outrageous nonsense as "The Little Peach" and
"The Onion Tart," one suddenly draws a sharp breath. At last
the heart of Eugene Field:</p>

</div></div>

<p class="in0">A lyric worthy of any anthology. Yet one quickly finds that it
is not Eugene Field at all. He wrote it deliberately as a hoax,
a practical joke on Modjeska, who all the rest of her life was
obliged to deny the authorship which Field had cunningly fastened
upon her. The case is typical. Like Riley, the man is
making copy. He uses pathos and sentiment and the most sacred
things as literary capital. One wonders where one can draw
the line. Was he really sincere in his child lyrics and his bibliomaniac
writings or was he cleverly playing a part?</p>

<p>In criticizing Field one must remember the essential immaturity
of the man. His frequent artificiality and his lack of sincerity
came from his boyishness and his high spirits. He looked
at life from the angle of mischievous boyhood. Moreover, he
wrote always at the high tension of the newspaper office, for a
thing that had no memory, a column that had but one demand&mdash;<i>more</i>!
It bred in him what may be denominated, perhaps, the
ephemeral habit. He was all his life a man preëminently and
predominatingly of the present moment, and thus he stands a
type of the literary creator that was to follow him.</p>

<p>For Field more than any other writer of the period illustrates
the way the old type of literary scholar was to be modified and
changed by the newspaper. Every scrap of Field's voluminous
product was written for immediate newspaper consumption.
He patronized not at all the literary magazines, he wrote his
books not at all with book intent&mdash;he made them up from newspaper
fragments. He wrote always a timely thing to the people,
a thing growing out of the present moment for the people to read,
making palatable for them even Horace and the severer classics.
He was thus one of the leading forces in what may be called
that democratizing of literature for which the period so largely
stands.</p>

<p>He has been given a place far beyond his real deserts. The
sentiment of "Little Boy Blue" and the other child lyrics, the
whimsical fun and high spirits of his comic verse, endeared him
to the public that enjoyed Riley. Then his whimsical, Goldsmith-like
personality helped his fame, as did also his death,
since it followed so quickly his late discovery by the reading
public that it gave the impression he had been removed like
Keats at the very opening of his career. He must be rated,
however, not for what he wrote, though a few pieces, like his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
child lyrics and his bibliomaniac ballads, will continue long in
the anthologies, but for the influence he exerted. He was a
pioneer in a peculiar province: he stands for the journalization
of literature, a process that, if carried to its logical extreme, will
make of the man of letters a mere newspaper reporter.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>In his own estimation Field was distinctively a Western poet;
he gave to his poetry the name "Western verse"; and he refused
the offers of Dana and others because he was not at all in sympathy
with the Eastern ideals. To quote his biographer, he felt
that Chicago "was as far East as he could make his home without
coming within the influence of those social and literary
conventions that have squeezed so much of genuine literary
flavor out of our <span class="locked">literature."<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>What New York might have made of Field we may learn, perhaps,
from the career of Henry Cuyler Bunner, for nearly twenty
years the most brilliant poetic wit in the East. He, too, had
approached literature from the journalistic entrance. At eighteen
he had left school to begin an apprenticeship on the brilliant
but short-lived <i>Arcadian</i>, and at twenty-two he was editor of the
newly established <i>Puck</i>, a position that he held until his death
at forty-one.</p>

<p>No man ever turned off verse and prose with more facility or
in greater quantity. "The staff of the paper was very small,
and little money could be spent for outside contributions; and
there were many weeks when nearly half the whole number was
written by <span class="locked">Bunner."<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></span> Like Field, he could write a poem while
the office boy, who had brought the order, stood waiting for the
copy to carry back with him. For more than ten years he furnished
nearly all the humorous verse for the periodical, besides
numberless paragraphs, short stories, and editorials. But he
was more fastidious than Field, inasmuch as he kept this journalistic
material strictly unconnected with his name. It was a
thing alone of the editorial office, no more to be mingled with
his more literary product than Charles Lamb's India office books
were to be brought into his <i>Elia</i> essays. The greater number of
those who laughed over the verses of the whimsical "V. Hugo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
Dusenberry, professional poet," never once dreamed that he was
H.&nbsp;C. Bunner, author of the exquisite lyrics in <i>Airs from Arcady</i>
and <i>Rowen</i>, and the carefully wrought stories&mdash;French in
their atmosphere and their artistic finish&mdash;<i>Short Sixes</i> and <i>Love
in Old Cloathes</i>. The skilful parodies and timely renderings, the
quips and puns&mdash;all the voluminous mélange, indeed, of the
poetic Yorick&mdash;lie buried now in the files of <i>Puck</i>. Their creator
refused to republish them, and we to-day can but yield to
his wish and judge him only by that which he himself selected
for permanence.</p>

<p>Judged by this, Bunner undoubtedly is our chief writer of
<i>vers de société</i>, our laureate of the trivial. He is restrained,
refined, faultless. He is of the artificial world, where fans flutter
and dancers glide and youth is perennial. Triolets penciled
in the program while the orchestra breathed its melody, epigrams
over the tea-cups, conceits for a fan, <i>amours de voyage</i>, lines
written on the menu, <i>amoretti</i>, valentines&mdash;these are his work,
and no one has done them more daintily or with more skill of
touch. Trifles they are, to be sure, yet Bunner, like every master
of the form, makes of them more than trifles. A hint of
tears there may be, the faintest breath of irony, the suspicion,
vague as an intuition, of satire or facetiousness or philosophy,
the high spirits and the carelessness of youth, yet a flash here
and there into the deeps of life as, for instance, in "Betrothed"
and "A Poem in the Programme," and "She was a Beauty in
the Days when Madison was President."</p>

<p>The French forms, imported echoes of Dobson and Lang and
Gosse&mdash;ballades, rondels, rondeaux, and the like, that so bewitched
the younger poets of the mid-eighties&mdash;found in Bunner
perhaps their most skilful American devotee. Perhaps no one
but he has ever succeeded in English with the chant royal, or has
found it possible to throw into that most trivial of all verse
forms, triolets, a throb of life, as in "A Pitcher of Mignonette":</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span></p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A pitcher of mignonette<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In a tenement's highest casement:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Queer sort of flower-pot&mdash;yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That pitcher of mignonette<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is a garden in heaven set,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the little sick child in the basement&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pitcher of mignonette,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the tenement's highest casement.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>The period, especially in its later years, has run abundantly
to these trivial, though difficult, forms of verse. As poetry ceased
more and more to be a thing of vision and compelling power,
it became more and more a thing of daintiness and brilliancy.
The American <i>Lyra Elegantiarum</i> for the period has been more
sparkling and abundant than the English, more even than the
French. John Godfrey Saxe (1816&ndash;1887) belongs almost wholly
to the days of Holmes and Lowell, but the greater number of
our trivial makers fall into the group that was active during the
closing quarter of the century. To mention all of them would
be to call the roll of the younger American poets. Perhaps the
most noteworthy, however, are Mary Mapes Dodge (1838&ndash;1905),
whose dainty and tender "The Minuet" gives her a place in
the choir; James Jeffrey Roche (1847&ndash;1908); Walter Learned
(1847&mdash;&mdash;); Richard Kendall Munkittrick (1853&ndash;1911); Samuel
Minturn Peck (1854&mdash;&mdash;), in many respects the most
delightful of the group; Clinton Scollard (1860&mdash;&mdash;); John
Kendrick Bangs (1862&mdash;&mdash;), and such modern instances as
Oliver Herford, Gelett Burgess, and Carolyn Wells. One
might, indeed, collect a notable anthology of <i>vers de société</i> from
the files of <i>Life</i> alone.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>A large amount of the poetry of the era has been written by
women. After the war their thin volumes, bound in creamy
vellum and daintily tinted cloth, began more and more to fill the
book tables, until reviewers no longer could give separate notice
to them, but must consider the poets of a month in groups of
ten or twelve. The quality of the feminine product was high
enough to find place in the most exclusive monthlies, and the
quantity published was surprising. The <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, for
instance, during the decade from 1870 published 108 poems by
Longfellow, Whittier, Holmes, Lowell, and Aldrich, and 450
other poems, and of the latter 201 were by women. The feminine
novelists and short story writers, so conspicuous during all
the period, were, indeed, almost all poets, some of them voluminous.
One may note the names not only of the older group&mdash;Mrs.
Stuart Phelps Ward, Mrs. Cooke, Mrs. Spofford, Miss
Woolson&mdash;but of such later writers as Mrs. Freeman, Alice
Brown, Mrs. Deland, and Mrs. Riggs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
Very little of this mass of poetry has been strong enough to
demand republication from the dainty volumes in which it first
appeared. It has been smooth and often melodious, but for the
most part it has been conventional. Prevailingly it has been
short lyric song in minor key, gentle and sentimental&mdash;graceful
exercises in verse rather than voices from a soul stirred to utterance
and caring not. In a sonneteering age this feminine contingent
has swelled enormously the volume of sonnets. Helen
Hunt Jackson's thin volume contains one hundred, Louise
Chandler Moulton's one hundred and thirty-one, yet in both
collections occurs no sonnet one would dream of adding to the
select few that undoubtedly are worth while. Here and there
in Mrs. Jackson a bit of work like "Poppies on the Wheat,"
"Glimpses," "Vashti," that rises, perhaps, a little above the
level monotony of the times, but in the vital seventies in America
why should one have published sonnets? Even as she was shaping
them, Emma Lazarus (1849&ndash;1887) was demanding in major
key,</p>

<p>The life of Emma Lazarus was brief and externally eventless.
Born in New York City in a home of refinement and wealth, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
a child precocious, inclined to seriousness, intense, she passed
her early life among books rather than among companions. At
seventeen she had issued a collection of verses, melancholy even
above the usual poetry of women, valueless utterly; then at
twenty-one she had published again, now a long poem, Greek in
its chaste beauty, <i>Admetus</i>, inscribed "To My Friend Ralph
Waldo Emerson." Two forces were contending, even as they
had contended in Heine. In Paris in later years before the
Venus of the Louvre she wrote a sonnet, and, miracle among
modern sonnets, it is impassioned, unfettered, alive&mdash;a woman's
soul:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">... I saw not her alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Serenely poised on her world-worshiped throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when she guided once her dove-drawn car,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But at her feet a pale, death-stricken Jew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her life adorer, sobbed farewell to love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here <i>Heine</i> wept! Here still he weeps anew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor ever shall his shadow lift or move,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While mourns one ardent heart, one poet-brain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For vanished Hellas and Hebraic pain.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>Until 1876 quiet emotion, Hellenic beauty, romance without
passion. "Tannhäuser" suggests William Morris and <i>The
Earthly Paradise</i>. Then came <i>The Spagnioletto</i>, a tense drama,
which showed for the first time the latent embers in her Hebraic
soul. It needed but a breath to kindle them and that breath
came with reports of the Jewish massacres of 1879. No more
of Hellenism. With Liebhaid in <i>The Dance of Death</i>, that most
tense drama in American literature, she could cry out:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">No more of that.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am all Israel's now&mdash;till this cloud pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have no thought, no passion, no desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save for my people.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>Henceforth fiery lyrics of denunciation, rallying cries, translations
of Hebrew prophets, songs of encouragement and cheer,
as "The Crowing of the Red Cock," "In Exile," "The New
Ezekiel," "The Valley of Baca," and, most Hebraic of all, "The
Banner of the Jew," with its ringing lines:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span></p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, for Jerusalem's trumpet now,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To blow a blast of shattering power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wake the sleepers high and low,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And rouse them to the urgent hour!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No hand for vengeance&mdash;but to save,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A million naked swords should wave.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>The fire was too intense for the frail, sensitive body. Suddenly,
like Heine, she was on a "mattress grave," powerless,
though never so eager, never so quivering with burning message.
She died at thirty-eight.</p>

<p>No more impetuous and Hebraic lines in the literature of the
period than hers. Often she achieved a distinction of phrase
and an inevitableness of word and of rhythm denied to all but
the truest of poets. No other American woman has surpassed
her in passion, in genuineness of emotion, in pure lyric effect.</p>

<p>Other impassioned singers there have been. Ella Wheeler
Wilcox (1855&mdash;&mdash;) wrote of love with lyric abandon, but she
mingled too much of sentimentality and all too much of posing
and of tawdriness. Anne Reeve Aldrich (1866&ndash;1892) in <i>Songs
About Life, Love, and Death</i> struck deeper notes, and Elizabeth
Akers Allen (1832&ndash;1911), though she wrote exceedingly much
in the key of the conventional mid-century sadness and longing,
yet now and then sent forth lyrics that laid bare her woman's
soul.</p>

<p>One may not dismiss so confidently Celia Thaxter, the poet
of the <i>Isles of Shoals</i>. She was, to be sure, no dominating voice
in the period, no poet with whom distinction of phrase and
poetic melody were native and spontaneous. Rather was she of
the Jean Ingelow type, feminine, domestic, tremulous with sentiment.
In one area, however, she commanded: her poetry of the
sea was autochthonic, and it sprang not from books, but from her
life. Her childhood she had passed in the seclusion of the lighthouse
keeper's home on White Island, a storm-beaten rock off
the New Hampshire coast. For months at a time no visitors
came save the sea gulls and the migrating birds. Her companion
through all her young girlhood was the ocean. She grew
to know intimately all its thousand moods, the sea gardens along
the rocks at low tide, the ships that hovered like clouds on the
horizon, the flowers in the rock crannies, the sandpipers that
flitted before her on the beach. The birds that flew against the
lantern of the lighthouse on migrating nights furnished the first
tragedy of her life:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Many a May morning have I wandered about the rock at the foot
of the tower, mourning over a little apron brimful of sparrows, swallows,
thrushes, robins, fire-winged blackbirds, many-colored warblers
and fly-catchers, beautifully clothed yellow-birds, nuthatches, catbirds,
even the purple finch and scarlet tanager and golden oreole, and many
more besides&mdash;enough to break the heart of a small child to think of!<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>No ordinary child, this lonely little islander. The lure of the
sea possessed her, the terror of its storms, the beauty of its
summer moods, the multitudinous variety of its voice. "Many
a summer morning have I crept out of the still house before any
one was awake, and, wrapping myself closely from the chill wind
of dawn, climbed to the top of the high cliff called the Head
to watch the sunrise." It was this communion with the sea that
awoke the poet soul within her:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Ever I longed to <i>speak</i> these things that made life so sweet, to speak
the wind, the cloud, the bird's flight, the sea's murmur. A vain longing!
I might as well have sighed for the mighty pencil of Michel
Angelo to wield in my impotent child's hand. Better to "hush and
bless one's self with silence"; but ever the wish grew. Facing the July
sunsets, deep red and golden through and through, or watching the
summer northern lights&mdash;battalions of brilliant streamers, advancing and
retreating, shooting upward to the zenith, and glowing like fiery veils
before the stars; or when the fog bow spanned the silver mist of
morning, or the earth and sea lay shimmering in a golden haze of
noon; in storm or calm, by day or night, the manifold aspects of Nature
held me and swayed all my thoughts until it was impossible to be
silent any longer, and I was fain to mingle my voice with her myriad
voices, only aspiring to be in accord with the Infinite harmony, however
feeble and broken the notes might <span class="locked">be.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>The first poem of hers to gain the ear of the public was "Land-Locked,"
accepted by Lowell and published in the <i>Atlantic</i>,
March, 1861. Its closing stanzas ring with sincerity. It is the
voice of every inland dweller whose youth has been spent by
the sea:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Neither am I ungrateful; but I dream<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Deliciously how twilight falls to-night<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Over the glimmering water, how the light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dies blissfully away, until I seem<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To feel the wind, sea-scented, on my cheek,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To catch the sound of dusky flapping sail<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And dip of oars, and voices on the gale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Afar off, calling low&mdash;my name they speak!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O Earth! thy summer song of joy may soar<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ringing to heaven in triumph. I but crave<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The sad, caressing murmur of the wave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That breaks in tender music on the shore.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>About all her poetry of the sea there are genuineness and
truth to experience. All of them are fragments of autobiography:
"Off Shore," "The Wreck of the Pocahontas," "The
Sandpiper," "Watching," "At the Breakers' Edge," "The
Watch of Boon Island," "Leviathan"&mdash;all of them have in them
the heart of the northern Atlantic. They are not deep like
Whitman's mighty voicings, but they are the cry of one who
knew and loved the sea better than any other American who has
ever written about it.</p>

<p>Her prose study <i>Among the Isles of Shoals</i>, overflorid though
it may be in places, is nevertheless one of the notable books of
the period. Nowhere may one find so complete a picture of the
northern ocean in all its moods and aspects. Its pictures of
storm and wreck, its glimpses of the tense and hazardous life
of dwellers by the ocean, its disclosings of the mystery and the
subtle lure of the sea, stir one at times like the deeper notes of
poetry.</p>

<p>One of the most perplexing of later poetic problems came in
1890 with the publication by Thomas Wentworth Higginson of
the posthumous poetry of Emily Dickinson (1830&ndash;1886). The
explanation by Higginson that the poet was a daughter of the
treasurer of Amherst College, that she was a recluse "literally
spending years without setting her foot beyond the doorstep
and many more years during which her walks were strictly
limited to her father's grounds," and that she had written
"verses in great abundance," refusing, however, save in three
or four instances, to allow any of them to be published, that she
wrote "absolutely without thought of publication, and solely by
way of expression of the writer's own mind,"&mdash;all this aroused
curiosity. At last one might see, perchance, a woman's soul.</p>

<p>The poems are disappointing. Critics have echoed Higginson,
until Emily Dickinson has figured, often at length, in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
the later histories and anthologies, but it is becoming clear that
she was overrated. To compare her eccentric fragments with
Blake's elfin wildness is ridiculous. They are mere conceits,
vague jottings of a brooding mind; they are crudely wrought,
and, like their author's letters, which were given to the public
later, they are colorless and for the most part lifeless. They
reveal little either of Emily Dickinson or of human life generally.
They should have been allowed to perish as their author
intended.</p>

<p>Most of the feminine poets of the later generation have been
over-literary. There is grace and finish in the work of Louise
Imogen Guiney (1861&mdash;&mdash;), but nowhere in all her carefully
selected final volume, <i>Happy Ending</i>, are there lines that suddenly
send the pulses into quicker beat and haunt the memory.
It is beautiful, but it is of a piece with ten thousand other beautiful
pieces; there is nothing to compel the reader, nothing to
lead him into fresh fields. Of all too many of the later feminine
poets may we say this: of Ina Donna Coolbrith, for instance, and
Helen Gray Cone (1859&mdash;&mdash;), Dora Read Goodale (1866&mdash;&mdash;),
Katharine Lee Bates (1859&mdash;&mdash;).</p>

<p>Only one other feminine singer has done work that compels
attention, Edith Matilda Thomas (1854&mdash;&mdash;). Only by birth
and rearing was she of Ohio. To read her poems is to be transported
into that no-man's land which so many poets have called
Arcady. She is more Greek than American. She has reacted
little upon her time, and she might be dismissed with mere mention
were there not in many of her poems a lyric distinction that
has been rare in American poetry. A fragment from her work
will make this clearer than exposition. Here, for instance, are
the opening stanzas of "Syrinx":</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span></p>

<span class="i2">No ambushed harm, no wanton's peering eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shepherd's uncouth god thou needst not fear&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pan has not passed this way for many a year.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No ruder stir, no footstep pressing near&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pan has not passed this way for many a year.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">Unlooked-for music indeed from the banks of the Ohio. Her
muse was remote, unimpassioned, classical, yet no lyrist of the
period has had more of the divine poetic gift of expression. She
seems curiously out of place in the headlong West in those
stormy closing years of the nineteenth century.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Belated singers of the mid-century music were Richard Watson
Gilder (1844&ndash;1909), Edward Roland Sill (1841&ndash;1887), George
E. Woodberry (1855&mdash;&mdash;), and Henry Van Dyke (1852&mdash;&mdash;),
all of them poets like Miss Thomas, who were remote from their
era, workers in art and beauty rather than voices and leaders.</p>

<p>One may pause long with Gilder. No other man of his generation
did so much to turn the direction of the period and to
determine its nature. As managing editor of <i>Scribner's
Monthly</i> from the first number to the last, and then after the
death of Holland, editor of the <i>Century Magazine</i>, he exerted
for twenty-eight years an influence upon American letters that
cannot be overestimated. In a way he is the central literary
figure of the period, even more so than Dr. Holland. More than
any one else he was responsible for the revolution in magazine
management for which the period stands, and more than any
one else he helped to gather the new school of novelists and
short story writers and poets that made the era distinctive. He
was the James T. Fields of the national period.</p>

<p>He was first of all an editor, then he was a humanitarian,
active in all movements for city betterment, then he was a poet.
Beginning with <i>The New Day</i> in 1875, he issued many small
volumes of delicate verse, mystical often in tone, always serious,
always artistic. That he knew the divine commission of the
poet he revealed in his volume <i>The Celestial Passion</i>, 1878:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span></p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dost thou not know this is the poet's lot:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mid sounds of war&mdash;in halcyon times of peace&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To strike the ringing lyre and not to cease;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In hours of general happiness to swell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The common joy; and when the people cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With piteous voice loud to the pitiless sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis his to frame the universal prayer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And breathe the balm of song upon the accursed air?<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">But he himself seemed not bound by this ideal of the poet. His
carefully wrought verses add little that is new, and little that
may be understood by those for whom a poet should sing. They
lack substance, the <i>Zeitgeist</i>, masculinity. Stedman could say
that they are "marked by the mystical beauty, intense emotion,
and psychological emotion of the elect <i>illuminati</i>," but the criticism,
even were it true, was condemnatory. Gilder's definition
did not mention the "elect <i>illuminati</i>."</p>

<p>It is depressing to think that this most virile of men, who
was the tireless leader of his generation in so many beneficent
fields of activity, must be judged in the coming periods solely
by this volume of poems. For classic poetry was not his life-work,
not his enthusiasm, not himself&mdash;it was a rarely furnished
room in the heart of his home, rather, where at times he might
retire from the tumult and enjoy the beauty he had gathered
in the realms of gold. He was not a poet, singing inevitable
lines, spontaneous and inspired. His poems lacked lyric distinction,
that compelling quality that sinks a poem into the
reader's soul, and, lacking it, they have little hope for permanence.
They are finished always and coldly beautiful, but finish
and beauty are not enough. So it is with George E. Woodberry's
polished work, and Father Tabb's. It is not vital with
the life of an epoch, it is not the voice of a soul deeply stirred
with a new and compelling message. All too often it has come
from deliberate effort; it is a mere performance.</p>

<p>With the work of Edward Rowland Sill one must be less positive.
Here we find conflict, reaction, spontaneous expression.
He was by no means a voice of his era, a robust shouter like
Whitman and Miller: he was a gentle, retiring soul who felt out
of place in his generation. Seriousness had come to him as a
birthright. Behind him were long lines of Connecticut Puritans.
He was frail, moreover, of physique, with a shrinking
that was almost feminine from all that was discordant and
assertive. After his graduation at Yale, the poet of his class,
in 1861, he was unable to settle upon a profession. He attempted
theology, and then, disillusioned, for bare support he
drifted into teaching. Year after year passed with the problem
unsettled, until he awoke to find that teaching was to be his life-work.
He had hidden among the children in the schoolroom,
and the things he had dreamed over had passed him by. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
external biography is largely a list of schools and positions.
At forty-six he died.</p>

<p>Poetry to Sill was a peculiarly personal thing, almost as much
so as it was to Emily Dickinson. He was not eager to publish,
and much that he did send to the magazines bore other names
than his own. He wrote, as Thoreau wrote his journal, with
simple directness for himself and the gods, and as a result we
have in his work the inner history of a human soul. There is
no artificiality, no sentimental vaporings, no posing for effect.
It is not art; it is life.</p>

<p>Here is poetry of struggle, poetry not of the spirit of an
epoch but of the life of an individual at odds with the epoch,
introspective, personal. One thinks of Clough, who also was
a teacher, a gentle soul oppressed with doubts and fears, a struggler
in the darkness of the late nineteenth century. But Sill
was less masculine than Clough. His doubtings are gentle and
half apologetic. Never is he bitter or excited or impetuous. To
such robust climaxes as "Say not the Struggle Naught Availeth"
he is incapable of rising: he broods, but he is resigned.
He exhorts himself deliberately to cheerfulness and faith and
to heights of manhood where all that is low may fall away.
Erotic passion has no part in his work. He has deliberately
conquered it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Is my life but Marguerite's ox-eyed flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I should stand and pluck and fling away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One after one, the petal of each hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a love-dreamy girl, and only say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Loves me," and "loves me not," and "loves me"? Nay!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let the man's mind awake to manhood's power.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>No poet has shrunk more sensitively from the realistic, material
age of which he was a part than Sill. His poems deal
with the realm of the spirit rather than with the tangible. They
are without time and place and material basis. One may illustrate
with the poems he wrote for Yale gatherings. They are
colorless: change but the name and they would apply as well
to Harvard or Princeton. Read in connection with Hovey's
dramatic, intensely individual Dartmouth poems and they seem
like beautiful clouds. They are serious, often over-serious, they
have no trace of humor, they deal with the soul life of one upon
whom the darkness threatens constantly to fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
His claim to remembrance comes not from lyrical inspiration,
for he was not lyrically gifted. He lacked what Gilder and
Woodberry lacked. Once in a while he made a stanza that approaches
lyric distinction, as, perhaps, in this final one of "A
Foolish Wish":</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Tis a child's longing, on the beach at play:<br /></span>
<span class="i14">"Before I go,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He begs the beckoning mother, "Let me stay<br /></span>
<span class="i14">One shell to throw!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis coming night; the great sea climbs the shore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, let me toss one little pebble more,<br /></span>
<span class="i14">Before I go!<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">But not often lines so inevitable. His power came largely from
the beauty and purity of his own personality. His own conception
of a poem was, that "coming from a pure and rich
nature, it shall leave us purer and richer than it found us."
Judged by such a standard, Sill holds a high place among the
poets. Nothing that he has written but leaves us purer and
richer of soul and more serious before the problems of life.
Eight or ten of his lyrics for a long time undoubtedly will hold
their place among the very highest pieces of American reflective
poetry.</p>

<p>It was the opinion of Edmund Gosse that the period was notably
deficient in serious <span class="locked">verse.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></span> No statement could be more wide
of the mark; the period has abounded in serious poetry and its
quality has been high. To consider in detail this mass of poetry,
however, were to exceed our limits. We can only single out
one here and there a little more notable than the others&mdash;John
Boyle O'Reilly (1844&ndash;1890), for instance, with his Celtic fancy
and his graphic power to depict life in the Southern Seas;
Maurice Francis Egan (1852&mdash;&mdash;) and Lloyd Mifflin (1846&mdash;&mdash;),
makers of beautiful and thoughtful sonnets; S. Weir
Mitchell (1829&ndash;1914), a poet of rare distinction as well as a
novelist; Frank Dempster Sherman (1860&ndash;1916), maker of madrigals
and joyous lyrics; Charles Warren Stoddard (1825&ndash;1903),
whose songs have a lyric quality that is distinctive, and
Abram Joseph Ryan (1839&ndash;1886), a beautiful and heroic soul,
who had he written but a single lyric would occupy a high place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
among American poets. His "The Conquered Banner" was the
voice of a people:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Furl that Banner, softly, slowly!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Treat it gently&mdash;it is holy&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For it droops above the dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Touch it not&mdash;unfold it never&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let it droop there, furled forever,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For its people's hopes are fled.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The two most prominent younger poets of the South were
Robert Burns Wilson (1850&ndash;1916) and Madison Cawein (1865&ndash;1914),
both residents of Kentucky, one at Frankfort, the other
at Louisville, and both contemplative Nature poets who voiced
but little the spirit of their period. Of the two, Wilson undoubtedly
was the most inspired singer, as Cawein was the most
careful observer of Nature.</p>

<p>Of Wilson we may say that he was a later Thomas Buchanan
Read, a devotee of art, a painter of landscapes and portraits,
whose work was seen in many distinctive galleries, and in addition
to this a poet&mdash;most pictorial of poets, whose stanzas seem
like inscriptions for his paintings. When the lyrics "When
Evening Cometh On" and "June Days" appeared in <i>Harper's</i>
in 1885, it was felt that a new singer had come. There was distinction
in the lines, there was restraint, there was more than
promise, there was already fulfilment. One feels a quality in
a stanza like this that he may not explain:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Though all the birds be silent&mdash;though<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The fettered stream's soft voice be still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the leafless bough the snow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Be rested, marble-like and chill&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet will the fancy build from these<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The transient but well-pleasing dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of leaf and bloom among the trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And sunlight glancing on the stream.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>It has somehow the singing quality that may not be learned,
that may not be taught. Finer still when there is joined with it
graphic power that arrests and pleases the eye, and pathos that
grips hard the heart, as in a lyric like this:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Such is the death the soldier dies:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He falls&mdash;the column speeds away;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Upon the dabbled grass he lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His brave heart following, still, the fray.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The smoke-wraiths drift among the trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The battle storms along the hill;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The glint of distant arms he sees;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hears his comrades shouting still.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">A glimpse of far-borne flags, that fade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And vanish in the rolling din:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He knows the sweeping charge is made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cheering lines are closing in.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Unmindful of his mortal wound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He faintly calls and seeks to rise;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But weakness drags him to the ground&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such is the death the soldier dies.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">Wilson's poetic product was small, but it stands distinctive.</p>

<p>The work of Cawein has been far more widely trumpeted. He
had the good fortune to attract the attention of Howells with
his first book and to be commended by him persistently and with
no uncertain voice. "There is much that is expressive of the
new land," Howells wrote in "The Editor's Study," "as well
as of the young life in its richly sensuous, boldly achieved pieces
of color. In him one is sensible (or seems so) of something different
from the beautiful as literary New England or literary
New York conceived it. He is a fresh <span class="locked">strain."<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></span> He deplored
the gorgeous excesses of the poems and the touches for merely
decorative effect, but he defended them as the natural exuberance
of extreme youth. With time they would disappear: undoubtedly
a great poet had arisen. Thus encouraged, Cawein
began upon a poetic career that in single-hearted devotion to the
lyric muse has been equaled only by Clinton Scollard. Before
his death he had issued more than twenty volumes of lyrics and
his collected work had been published in five thick volumes.</p>

<p>The final estimate of the poet cannot yet be written. It is too
soon, but even now one may venture certain predictions.
Cawein wrote enormously too much, and he wrote all too often
with merely literary intent. He was not a lyrist born: he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
little ear for music, and he blended meters and made rimes seemingly
with the eye alone. One can not feel that a passage like
this, for instance, sang itself spontaneously:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i25">Seemed that she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Led me along a flower-showered lea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trammeled with puckered pansy and the pea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where poppies spread great blood-red stain on stain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So gorged with sunlight and the honied rain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their hearts are weary; roses lavished beams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roses, wherein were huddled little dreams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That laughed coy, sidewise merriment, like dew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or from fair fingers fragrant kisses blew.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>There is a straining constantly for the unusual in epithet, a
seeking for a picturing adjective that shall give verisimilitude
in an utterly new way. "The songs have all been sung," he
would seem to argue, "but the picturing adjectives have not
all been used and the striking conceits." One might open at
random for an illustration:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Athwart a sky of brass long welts of gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A bullion bulk the wide Ohio lies.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Up from the glimmering east the full moon swung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A golden bubble buoyed zenithward.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Between the pansy fire of the west,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And poppy mist of moonrise in the east,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This heartache will have ceased.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>"It is as if we had another Keats," says Howells, and in saying
it he touches the fatal weakness of the poet. There is lack
of virility in great parts of his work, there is lack of definiteness
and of vigor. He tells nothing new and he adds nothing to the
old by his telling. Even Baskerville can say, "There is little
or no Southern, not to say Kentucky, atmosphere in Mr.
Cawein's poetry. His flowers and birds and rocks and trees do
not appear to us as objects of the rich, warm Southern nature.
He frequently mentions the whole register of flowers and birds
in his poetry&mdash;almost, we might say, drags them into his descriptions
by force&mdash;but he has not created a warm, genial,
Southern poetic atmosphere in which they may <span class="locked">thrive."<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
Nevertheless, it is only in his Nature poetry that he is at all
convincing. He can paint a summer noon, or a summer shower,
and he can detail minutely the flowers and the mosses and the
birds in an old fence corner or an old garden. Pictures like this
have, undoubtedly, a certain kind of value:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Bubble-like the hollyhocks<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Budded, burst, and flaunted wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gipsy beauty from their stocks;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Morning-glories, bubble-dyed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swung in honey-hearted flocks.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tawny tiger-lilies flung<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Doublets slashed with crimson on;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Graceful girl slaves, fair and young,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like Circassians, in the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alabaster lilies swung.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah, the droning of the bee<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In his dusty pantaloons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tumbling in the fleurs-de-lis;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the drowsy afternoons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dreaming in the pink sweet-pea.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>Always is he heavy with adjectives, profuse, gorgeous; always
is he dreamy and remote. One turns page after page of the
thick volumes of the collected lyrics to find some simple human
bit that came hot from the heart of a poet, some stanza that
compels quotation, but one gets lost at length in the maze of
sweetness. If any of his poems are to outlast their generation
it will be some of the Nature pieces, but landscape studies, flower
songs, and pretty conceits about bees and birds are thin material
of which to make enduring poetry.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>With Richard Hovey (1864&ndash;1900), representative of the poets
of the second generation of the National period, our survey
closes. Hovey was a later Lanier, excited, impetuous, possessed
by poetry until it ruled all his thinking. Like Lanier, he was
Gallic of temperament rather than Teutonic. He read enormously&mdash;the
Elizabethans, Tennyson, Whitman, the pre-Raphaelites,
Dobson, Kipling, and later, in France, Paul Verlaine,
Maeterlinck, Stéphane Mallarmé, and all the later symbolists.
After his college course at Dartmouth he was, at brief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
intervals, theological student, newspaper reporter, actor, lecturer
in Alcott's Concord school of philosophy, and in his last year,
like Lanier, professor of literature in one of the larger universities&mdash;Barnard
College, New York&mdash;yet his one profession all
his life long was poetry. His facility was marvelous. He
wrote an elegy of purest Greek type and he added a canto to
<i>Don Juan</i>; he wrote Arthurian masques and dramas and then
rollicking Bohemian songs and <i>vers de société</i>.</p>

<p>His facility was his weakness. Like Lanier he was too excited,
too given to improvisation and the blending of meters.
His dramatic interludes like <i>The Quest of Merlin</i> and <i>Taliesin</i>
are marvelous in their workmanship, their mastery of all the intricacies
of prosody, but they come near to being void of human
interest. Lanier dominated his first poem <i>The Laurel</i> and there
are echoes of Whitman and others in his later work. He matured
slowly. At his death he had arrived at a point where there
was promise of creative work of highest distinction. He was
breaking from his Bohemianism and his excited Swinburnian
music and was touching his time. His definition of poetry
makes his early death seem like a tragedy. Of the poet he
wrote, "It is not his mission to write elegant canzonettas for the
delectation of the Sybaritic dilettanti, but to comfort the sorrowful
and hearten the despairing, to champion the oppressed
and declare to humanity its inalienable rights, to lay open to
the world the heart of man, all its heights and depths, all its
glooms and glories, to reveal the beauty in things and breathe
into his fellows a love of it and so a love of Him whose manifestation
it is.... In the appointed work of every people, the
poets have been the leaders and <span class="locked">pioneers."<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>His most finished work is his elegy on the death of Thomas
William Parsons, <i>Seaward</i>, which at times has a lyric quality
that brings it into the company even of <i>Adonais</i> and <i>Thyrsis</i>.
One is tempted to quote more than a single stanza:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span></p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Far, far, so far, the crying of the surf!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Still, still, so still, the water in the grass!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here on the knoll the crickets in the turf<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And one bold squirrel barking, seek, alas!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bring the swarming summer back to me.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In vain; my heart is on the salt morass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Below, that stretches to the sunlit sea.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>His most spontaneous and original outbursts are doubtless his
Dartmouth lyrics&mdash;a series distinctive among college poetry,
worthy of a place beside Dr. Holmes's Harvard lyrics&mdash;and
his rollicking convivial songs that have in them the very soul
of good fellowship. There is in all he wrote a Whitman-like
masculinity. He could make even so conventional a thing as
a sonnet a thing to stir the blood with:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When I am standing on a mountain crest,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or hold the tiller in the dashing spray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My love of you leaps foaming in my breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shouts with the winds and sweeps to their foray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My heart bounds with the horses of the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And plunges in the wild ride of the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flaunts in the teeth of tempest the large glee<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That rides out Fate and welcomes gods to flight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ho, love! I laugh aloud for love of you,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Glad that our love is fellow to rough weather;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No fretful orchid hot-housed from the dew,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But hale and hearty as the highland heather,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Rejoicing in the wind that stings and thrills,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Comrade of ocean, playmate of the hills.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>He is the singer of men&mdash;of Western men, red-blooded and
free&mdash;the very opposite of Cawein. He wrote songs to be sung
in barrack rooms and at college reunions&mdash;songs of comradeship
and masculine joy:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Give a rouse, then, in the Maytime<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For a life that knows no fear!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn night-time into daytime<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With the sunlight of good cheer!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">For it's always fair weather<br /></span>
<span class="i3">When good fellows get together<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a stein on the table and a good song ringing clear.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">And again this</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Comrades, give a cheer to-night,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For the dying is with dawn!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, to meet the stars together,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With the silence coming on!<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Greet the end<br /></span>
<span class="i6">As a friend a friend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When strong men die together.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>His Launcelot and Guenevere cycle, which was to be complete
in nine dramas, only four of which he lived to finish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
though undoubtedly the best was yet to come, has in it enough
of strength to make for itself, fragment as it is, a high place
in our literature. The dramas are in different key from Tennyson's.
In the <i>Idyls of the King</i> the old legend is domesticated
and the table round is turned into a tea table. Hovey in
his <i>Marriage of Guenevere</i> and <i>The Birth of Galahad</i> puts virile
power into his knights, makes of Launcelot the hero of the cycle,
and gives to Guenevere a reality that is Shakespearian. Few indeed
have been the poets of the younger school who have dared
to plan on so grand a scale or to venture to offer something new
in a field that has been so thoroughly exploited.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE TRIUMPH OF THE SHORT STORY</span></h2>

<p>Voluminous as may seem the poetry of the period when viewed
by itself, it sinks into insignificance when viewed against the
mass of prose that was contemporaneous with it. Overwhelmingly
was it an age of prose fiction. He who explores it emerges
with the impression that he has been threading a jungle chaotic
and interminable. To chart it, to find law and tendency in it,
seems at first impossible. For a generation or more every
writer seems to have had laid upon him a necessity for narration.
Never before such widespread eagerness to din tales into
the ears of a world.</p>

<p>It was an age of brief fiction&mdash;this fact impresses one first of
all. The jungle growth was short. Not half a dozen writers
in the whole enormous group confined themselves to novels of
length; the most distinctive fictional volumes of the period:
<i>The Luck of Roaring Camp</i>, <i>Old Creole Days</i>, <i>In the Tennessee
Mountains</i>, <i>Nights with Uncle Remus</i>, <i>In Ole Virginia</i>, <i>A New
England Nun</i>, <i>Deephaven</i>, <i>Main-Traveled Roads</i>, <i>Flute and Violin</i>,
and the like, were collections of tales. One may venture to
call the period the age of the short story, or more accurately,
perhaps, the age of short-breathed work. Everywhere literature
in small parcels. In January, 1872, the <i>North American Review</i>,
guardian of the old traditions, thought the conditions serious
enough to call for earnest protest:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A new danger has recently shown itself.... The great demand on
all sides is for <i>short</i> books, <i>short</i> articles, <i>short</i> sketches; no elaborate
essays, no complete monographs, are wanted ... condensed thought,
brief expression, the laconian method everywhere.... The volume
sinks into an article, the article dwindles to an item to conciliate the
demands of the public.</p></blockquote>

<p>That this shortness of unit was a sign of weakness, we to-day
by no means concede. It was rather a sign of originality, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
symptom of a growing disregard for British methods and British
opinion. The English genius always has been inclined to ponderousness&mdash;to
great, slow-moving novels, to elaborate essays
that get leisurely under way, to romances that in parts are
treatises and in parts are histories, everywhere to solidity and
deliberateness of gait. The <i>North American Review</i> protest was
a British protest; it was the protest of conservatism against what
to-day we can see was the new spirit of America. The American
people from the first had been less phlegmatic, less conservative,
than the English. There were climatic influences, it may be;
there was surely a spirit of intensity everywhere that made for
short efforts. The task of subduing in a single century a raw
continent produced a people intolerant of the leisurely and the
long drawn out. Poe perceived the tendency early. In a letter
to Professor Charles Anthon he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Before quitting the <i>Messenger</i> I saw, or fancied I saw, through a
long and dim vista the brilliant field for ambition which a magazine of
bold and noble aims presented to him who should successfully establish
it in America. I perceived that the country, from its very constitution,
could not fail of affording in a few years a larger proportionate
amount of readers than any upon earth. I perceived that the
whole energetic, busy spirit of the age tended wholly to magazine literature&mdash;to
the curt, the terse, the well timed and the readily diffused,
in preference to the old forms of verbose and ponderous and inaccessible.</p></blockquote>

<p>This far-sightedness made of Poe the father of the American
type of short story. Irving undoubtedly had sown the earliest
seeds, but Irving was an essayist and a sketch-writer rather
than a maker of short stories in the modern sense. It was Poe's
work to add art to the sketch&mdash;plot structure, unity of impression,
verisimilitude of details, matter-of-factness, <i>finesse</i>&mdash;and,
like Hawthorne, to throw over it the atmosphere of his own peculiar
personality. That he evolved the form deliberately can
not be doubted. In his oft-quoted review of Hawthorne's tales
he laid down what may be considered as the first rules for short
story writing ever formulated. His theories that all art is
short-breathed, that a long poem is a <i>tour de force</i> against nature,
and that the unit of measure in fiction is the amount that
may be read with undiminished pleasure at a single sitting, are
too well known to dwell upon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
But the short story of the mid-century, even in its best specimens,
was an imperfect thing. In Hawthorne's tales the quality
of the sketch or the essay is always discernible. All of Poe's
tales, and Hawthorne's as well, lack vigor of characterization,
sharpness of outline, swiftness of movement. "The Gold Bug,"
for instance, has its climax in the middle, is faulty in dialect, is
utterly deficient in local color, and is worked out with characters
as lifeless as mere symbols.</p>

<p>The vogue of the form was increased enormously by the annuals
which figured so largely in the literary history of the mid-century,
by the increasing numbers of literary pages in weekly
newspapers, and by the growing influence of the magazines.
The first volume of the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> (1857) had an average
of three stories in each number. But increase in quantity
increased but little the quality. The short story of the annual
was, for the most part, sentimental and over-romantic. Even
the best work of the magazines is colorless and ineffective when
judged by modern standards. Undoubtedly the best stories
after Poe and Hawthorne and before Harte are Fitz-James
O'Brien's "Diamond Lens," 1858, and "What Was It?" 1859,
Edward Everett Hale's "The Man Without a Country," 1863,
and "The Brick Moon," 1869, and Thomas Wentworth Higginson's
"The Haunted Window," 1867. Well wrought they
are for the most part, unusual in theme, and telling in effect,
yet are they open nevertheless to the same criticisms which we
have passed upon Poe.</p>

<p>The short story in its later form dates from Harte's "The Luck
of Roaring Camp." Harte added reality, sharpness of outline,
vividness of setting, vigor of characterization. The new period
demanded actuality. The writer must speak with authority; he
must have been a part of what he describes; he must have seen
with his own eyes and he must reproduce with a verisimilitude
that grips the reader and hastens him on as if he himself were
a participant in the action. There must be at every point sense
of actuality, and, moreover, strangeness&mdash;new and unheard-of
types of humanity, uncouth dialects, peculiar environments. It
was far more concentrated than the mid-century work, but it
was much more given to general description and background effects
and impressionistic characterization.</p>

<p>In the mid-eighties came the perfecting of the form, the molding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
of the short story into a finished work of art. Now was
demanded compression, nervous rapidity of movement, sharpness
of characterization, singleness of impression, culmination,
<i>finesse</i>&mdash;a studied artistry that may be compared with even
the best work of the French school of the same period. Stories
like those of Aldrich, Stockton, Bunner, Garland, Allen, Bierce,
Grace King, Mrs. Chopin, Stephen Crane, and Frank Norris,
from the standpoint of mere art at least, come near to perfection.</p>

<p>The decline of the short story, its degeneration into a journalistic
form, the substitution all too often of smartness, paradox,
sensation, for truth&mdash;all this is a modern instance outside
the limits prescribed for our study.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>After Harte and the early local-colorists the next to develop
the short story was Frank R. Stockton. No writer of the period
has been more variously estimated and labeled. By some critics
he has been rated as a mere humorist, by others as a novelist,
by still others as a writer of whimsicalities in a class by himself.</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly true that his personality was so interfused
with his writings that the generation who knew and loved him
were too kind in their judgments. Behind his every story they
saw the genial, whimsical creator and they laughed even before
they began to read. But a new generation has arrived to whom
Stockton is but a name and a set of books, and it is becoming
more and more evident now that very much that he wrote was
ephemeral. To this generation he is known as the author of a
single short story, or perhaps three or four short stories, of a
type that has its own peculiar flavor.</p>

<p>Stockton was born in Philadelphia in 1834, was educated in
the high school there, and then, at the request of his father,
learned the trade of wood engraving. But his inclinations were
literary, and he was soon an editorial worker on his brother's
newspaper. Later he joined the staff of <i>Hearth and Home</i> in
New York, then became connected with the new <i>Scribner's
Monthly</i>, and finally became assistant editor of <i>St. Nicholas</i>.</p>

<p>The wide popularity of his stories induced him at length to
withdraw from editorial work to devote his whole time to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
writings. He became exceedingly productive: after his fiftieth
year he published no fewer than thirty volumes.</p>

<p>To understand Stockton's contribution to the period one must
bear in mind that he adopted early the juvenile story as his
form of expression, and that his first book, <i>Ting-a-ling Stories</i>,
appeared four years after <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>. When, at the
age of forty-eight he gained general recognition with his <i>The
Lady, or the Tiger?</i> he had published nine books, eight of them
juveniles. The fact is important. He approached literature by
the Wonderland gate and he never wandered far from that
magic entrance. After his short stories had made him famous
he continued to write juveniles, adapting them, however, to his
new audience of adult readers. He may be summed up as a
maker of grown-up juveniles, a teller, as it were, of the adventures
of an adult Alice in Wonderland.</p>

<p>All of his distinctive work was short. <i>Rudder Grange</i>, which
first made him at all known, was a series of sketches, the humorous
adventures of a newly married couple, the humor consisting
largely of incongruous situations. Even his so-called
novels, like <i>The Casting Away of Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine</i>
and its sequel <i>The Dusantes</i>, are but a series of episodes joined
together as loosely as Alice's well-known adventures. Plot there
is really none. Characterization, however, there is to a degree:
the two women do carry their provincial Yankee personalities
and the atmosphere of their little home village into whatever
amazing environment they may find themselves, but one can
not say more.</p>

<p>There seems on the author's part a constant endeavor in all
of his work to invent incongruous situation and preposterous
suggestion, and a determination to present this topsy-turvy
world gravely and seriously as if it were the most commonplace
thing in the world. He makes it plausible by the Defoe method
of multiplying minor details and little realistic touches until
the reader is thrown completely off his guard. For instance,
in the novel <i>The Dusantes</i> the coach in which the party is traveling
is overtaken by night in the high mountains and before
morning is completely buried by a great snow storm. The following
day, after they had hollowed out a room for themselves
in the snow, this adventure befalls them:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>I heard a low crunching sound on one side of me, and, turning my
head, I saw in the wall of my excavation opposite to the stage coach
and at a distance of four or five feet from the ground an irregular hole
in the snow, about a foot in diameter, from which protruded the head
of a man. This head was wrapped, with the exception of the face, in
a brown woolen comforter. The features were those of a man of
about fifty, a little sallow and thin, without beard, whiskers, or mustache,
although the cheeks and chin were darkened with a recent
growth.</p>

<p>The astounding apparition of this head projecting itself from the
snow wall of my cabin utterly paralyzed me, so that I neither moved
nor spoke, but remained crouching by the fire, my eyes fixed upon the
head. It smiled a little, and then spoke.</p>

<p>"Could you lend me a small iron pot?" it said.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Another coach, it seems, had likewise been snowed under, and
the chief occupant had tried to tunnel his way out for help, with
the result as recorded. The passage is typical. It illustrates a
mannerism that mars all his work. He is not telling a culminating
story: he is adding incongruity to incongruity for merely
humorous effect, and after a time the reader tires. It seems
at length as if he were straining at every point to bring in something
totally unexpected and preposterous. In short compass
the device succeeded, but incongruity may not rule longer than
the moment.</p>

<p>It is to Stockton's short stories, then, that we are to look for
his distinctive work. Of one story we need say little. The sensation
it made has few parallels in the history of the period and
the influence it excited was undoubtedly great. Aldrich several
years earlier had told a story which depended for its effect
upon a startling closing sentence, but <i>Marjorie Daw</i> attracted
little attention as compared with the tremendous vogue of <i>The
Lady, or the Tiger?</i> It was a step in the direction of more
elaborate art. It began to be realized that the short story writer
had the reader at his mercy. It was recognized that it was a
part of his art to startle, to perplex, to tantalize, to lead into
hidden pitfalls, yet always in a way to please and to stimulate.
From <i>Marjorie Daw</i> and <i>The Lady, or the Tiger?</i> it was but a
step to the jugglery of O. Henry.</p>

<p>None of Stockton's other short stories ever reached the vogue
of this lucky hit, but many of them surpass it in all the requisites
of art. "Negative Gravity," "The Transferred Ghost," "The
Remarkable Wreck of the Thomas Hyke," and "The Late Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
Null" may be cited as examples. In all of them the art consists
in perfect naturalness, in an exquisite simplicity of style,
and in topsy-turvyness made within short compass completely
plausible. We are led into a world of negative gravity where
everything goes completely by opposites. In "The Transferred
Ghost" we are gravely assured that Mr. Hinckman, at the point
of death, has a ghost appointed to haunt his late residence. He
does not die, however, and as a result the poor ghost is haunted
by the living Mr. Hinckman until it is nearly frightened out of
its existence. And so skilful is the author that the story becomes
convincing.</p>

<p>Very much of the success of the work depends upon the element
that we call style. Stockton indeed is one of the half
dozen prose writers of the period to whom may be applied the
now old-fashioned term stylist. There is grace and character in
his every sentence, a dignity despite the whimsical content that
never descends to vulgarity or to what James has termed "newspaperese."
Always is he clear, always is he simple&mdash;his early
experience with juveniles taught him that&mdash;and always is he
perfectly natural. Moreover, to all this he adds a delightfully
colloquial attitude toward his reader&mdash;a familiar personal tone
at times that is like nothing so much as Charles Lamb.</p>

<p>He was an anomaly in the period. In an age of localized
fiction he produced work as unlocalized as is Carroll's <i>Through
the Looking Glass</i>; instead of using dialect and curious provincial
types, he dealt always with refined gentle folk amid surroundings
that seem to have little to do with the actual solid earth;
in a period that demanded reality and fullness of life he wrote
little that touches any of the real problems of his time or that has
in it anything to grip or even to move the reader: even his murders
are gentle affairs. There are no moments of real emotion:
all is <i>opéra bouffe</i>; all is cheery and whimsically conceived.</p>

<p>That there was knowledge of the human heart behind his
quaint creations undoubtedly is true. <i>The Lady, or the Tiger?</i>
is founded on a subtle study of humanity, yet even as one says
it he is forced to admit that it added little to the real substance
of the period. He was content to be a mere entertainer, aware
undoubtedly that the entertainment that delights one generation
all too often is obsolete in the next.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The appearance of "Monsieur Motte" in the <i>New Princeton
Review</i> of January, 1886, marks another step in the development
of the short story. It was as distinctively French in its
atmosphere and its art as if it had been a translation from Maupassant,
yet it was as originally and peculiarly American as
even <i>Madame Delphine</i>, which in so many ways it resembles.
Its English, which is Gallic in idiom and in incisive brevity;
its atmosphere quivering with passion; its characters whimsical,
impulsive, exquisite of manners; its dainty suggestions of femininity,
as in the case of the little Creole maiden Marie Modeste
or the stately Madame Lareveillère; its hints of a rich and tragic
background, and its startling "Marjorie Daw" culmination&mdash;there
is no Monsieur Motte; Monsieur Motte is only the pathetic
<i>négresse</i> Marcélite&mdash;all this was French, but the background
was old Creole New Orleans, and it was drawn by one who professed
herself a severe realist, or, to quote her own words, "I
am not a romanticist, I am a realist <i>à la mode de la Nouvelle-Orleans</i>.
I have never written a line that was not realistic, but
our life, our circumstances, the heroism of the men and women
that surrounded my early horizon&mdash;all that was romantic. I
had a mind very sensitive to romantic impressions, but critical as
to their expression."</p>

<p>The writer was Grace Elizabeth King, daughter of a prominent
barrister of New Orleans, herself with a strain of Creole
blood, educated at the fashionable Creole <i>pension</i> of the Mesdames
Cenas&mdash;the Institute St. Denis of "Monsieur Motte" and
"Pupasse"&mdash;bilingual like all the circle in which she moved,
and later a resident for some two years in France&mdash;no wonder
that from her stories breathes a Gallic atmosphere such as we
find in no other work of the period. Three more episodes, each
a complete short story&mdash;"On the Plantation," "The Drama of an
Evening," and "The Marriage of Marie Modeste"&mdash;she added to
her first story, bits of art that Flaubert would have delighted in,
and issued them in 1888 under the title <i>Monsieur Motte</i>. She
followed it with <i>Earthlings</i>, which she has never republished,
from <i>Lippincott's Magazine</i>, and with other stories and sketches
contributed to <i>Harper's</i> and the <i>Century</i> that later appeared as
<i>Tales of a Time and Place</i> and <i>Balcony Stories</i>.</p>

<p>The impulse to write fiction came to Miss King from a conviction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
that Cable had done scant justice to the real Creoles of
Louisiana. She would depict those exclusive circles of old
Creole life that she herself had known in her early childhood,
circles almost exclusively French with just a touch, perhaps, of
Spanish. She would differ from Cable as Sarah Orne Jewett
differs from Mary E. Wilkins Freeman in her pictures of New
England life. Her sketches, therefore, are more minutely
drawn, more gentle, more suggestive of the richness and beauty
of a vanished age that was Parisian and Bourbon in its brilliancy.
She excels in her pictures of old Mesdames, relics of
the old régime, drawn by the lightest of touches and suggestions
until they are intensely alive, like Bon Maman or like Madame
Josephine in "A Delicate Affair." A hint or a suggestion is
made to do the work of a page of analysis. Note a passage
like this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>She played her game of solitaire rapidly, impatiently, and always
won; for she never hesitated to cheat and get out of a tight place, or
into a favorable one, cheating with the quickness of a flash, and forgetting
it the moment afterward.</p>

<p>Mr. Horace was as old as she, but he looked much younger, although
his dress and appearance betrayed no evidence of an effort in that
direction. Whenever his friend cheated, he would invariably call her
attention to it; and as usual she would shrug her shoulders and say,
"Bah! Lose a game for a card!" and pursue the conversation.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">All her feminine creations are Gallic, like Marie Modeste, or,
better still, the vividly drawn Misette in <i>Earthlings</i>, volatile,
lovable&mdash;impossible. She is always at her best while depicting
these whimsical, impracticable, tropic femininites; she makes
them not so bewitching as does Cable, but she makes them more
real and more intensely alive.</p>

<p>Her earlier stories are the best, judged merely as short stories.
As she continued her work she discovered more and more the
wealth of romantic material in the annals of the old city, especially
in the studies of Charles Gayarré (1805&ndash;1895), greatest
of Southern historians. The influence of his work upon her
becomes increasingly evident. Her stories grew into sketches.
<i>Balcony Stories</i> are not so much stories as they are realistic
sketches of social conditions in New Orleans after the Reconstruction.
More and more she wrote studies in Creole atmospheres,
impressions of picturesque places and persons after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
manner of Hearn, until at length she abandoned fiction altogether
to devote herself to history. In the period when historical
fiction for a time ruled everything, she wrote history itself
in a manner that was as graphic and as picturesque as fiction.
Perhaps nothing that she has written has in it more of vitality
than her history of New Orleans and its people. It is possible
that her final place is to be with the historians rather than with
the makers of fiction.</p>

<p>In the technique of the short story she was surpassed by a
later worker in Louisiana materials, Kate Chopin (1851&ndash;1904),
some of whose work is equal to the best that has been produced
in France or even in America. She wrote but little, two volumes
of stories, notably <i>Bayou Folks</i>, containing all that is now
accessible of her shorter work. Many of her sketches and stories
have never been republished from the magazines.</p>

<p>The strength of Mrs. Chopin's work came partly from the
strangeness of her material&mdash;she told of the Grand Pré Acadians
in the canebrakes of central Louisiana&mdash;and from her intimate
knowledge of her field, but it came more from what may be
described as a native aptitude for narration amounting almost to
genius. She was of Celtic temperament&mdash;her father was a Galway
County Irishman and her mother was of mingled French
and old Virginian stock. Educated in the Convent of the Sacred
Heart at St. Louis, married at nineteen to a New Orleans
cotton factor, spending fourteen years in Louisiana, the last four
of them in the remote hamlet of Cloutiersville in Natchitoches
Parish, "a rambling little French village of one street, with the
Catholic church at one end, and our plantation at the other, and
the Red River flowing through everybody's backyard," left a
widow at thirty-five with six children&mdash;all this had little to do
with the making of literature. Indeed, until her return to St.
Louis a year after her bereavement, she had never even thought
of writing. She began almost by chance, and, succeeding from
the first, she wrote story after story almost without effort and
wholly without study of narrative art. For a decade her work
was in all of the Northern magazines, then five years before her
death, discouraged by the reception of her novel <i>The Awakening</i>,
she became silent.</p>

<p>No writer of the period was more spontaneously and inevitably
a story teller. There is an ease and a naturalness about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
her work that comes from more than mere art. She seldom
gave to a story more than a single sitting, and she rarely revised
her work, yet in compression of style, in forbearance, in the
massing of materials, and in artistry she ranks with even the
masters of the period. A story like "Desireé's Baby," with its
inevitableness and its culminating sentence that stops for an
instant the reader's heart, is well-nigh perfect. She was emotional,
she was minutely realistic, and, unlike Grace King, used
dialect sometimes in profusion; she was dramatic and even at
times melodramatic, yet never was she commonplace or ineffective.
She had command at times of a pervasive humor and a
pathos that gripped the reader before he was aware, for behind
all was the woman herself. She wrote as Dickens wrote, with
abandonment, with her whole self. There is art in her work,
but there is more than art. One may read again and again such
bits of human life as "Madame Celestin's Divorce": it is the art
that is independent of time and place, the art indeed that is universal.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Of a type the direct opposite was James Lane Allen, who was
not inspired and who was not an improvisatore. To Allen fiction
was an art learned with infinite patience. He was years
in the mastering of it, years in which he studied literature with
the abandonment of a Maupassant. He approached it deliberately;
he made himself the most scholarly of the novelists of the
period&mdash;graduate and graduate student of Transylvania University,
first applicant for the degree of doctor of philosophy at
Johns Hopkins, though he never found opportunity for residence,
teacher for years of languages, and then professor of
Latin and higher English at Bethany College, West Virginia.</p>

<p>The circumstances of his early life made a literary career
difficult. He had been born on a small Kentucky plantation
a few miles out of Lexington, miles that he walked daily while
gaining his education. A college course for him meant toil and
sacrifice. The war had brought poverty, and the death of the
father imposed new burdens. Like Lanier, he was forced to
teach schools when he would have studied at German universities,
but, like Lanier, he somehow had caught a vision of literature
that dominated him even through decades of seeming hopelessness.
Few have had to fight longer for recognition and few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
have ever worked harder to master the art with which they were
to make their appeal. Like Howells, he studied masters and
read interminably, pursuing his work into the German and the
French, writing constantly and rewriting and destroying. And
the result, as with Howells, was no immaturities. His first book,
<i>Flute and Violin</i>, published when he was forty-two, is by many
regarded as his best work. To his earliest readers it seemed as
if a new young writer had arrived to whom art was a spontaneous
thing mastered without effort.</p>

<p>A study of the available fragments of Allen's work written
earlier than the stories in this first volume reveals much. He
began as a critic. In Northern journals after 1883 one may find
many articles signed with his name: sharp criticisms of Henry
James, appreciations of Heine and Keats, studies of the art of
Balzac and his circle, letters on timely subjects which show the
wideness of his reading and the gradual shaping of his art. He
evolved his method deliberately after consideration of all that
had been done in England and America and France. By no
other writer of the period was the short story worked out with
more care or with more knowledge of requirements.</p>

<p>Especially significant is an article entitled "Local Color" in
the <i>Critic</i> of 1886. The time has come, he contended, when the
writer of fiction must broaden the old conceptions of art. Now
the novelist must be "in some measure a scientist; he must comprehend
the natural pictorial environment of humanity in its
manifold effects upon humanity, and he must make this knowledge
available for literary presentation." Other requirements
had become imperative:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>From an artistic point of view, the aim of local color should be
to make the picture of human life natural and beautiful, or dreary, or
somber, or terrific, as the special character of the theme may demand;
from a scientific point of view, the aim of local color is to make the
picture of human life natural and&mdash;intelligible, by portraying those
picturable potencies in nature that made it what it was and must go
along with it to explain what it is. The novelist must encompass both
aims.</p></blockquote>

<p>He must also be a stylist. "The happiest use of local color,"
he declares, "will test to the uttermost one's taste and attainments
as a language colorist." And again, "The utmost in the
use of local color should result, when the writer chooses the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
most suitable of all colors that are characteristic; when he makes
these available in the highest degree for artistic presentation;
and when he attains and uses the perfection of coloring in
style."</p>

<p>One makes another discovery as one works among these earlier
fragments: Allen, like Howells, was a poet. His first contributions
to the larger magazines&mdash;<i>Harper's</i> and the <i>Atlantic</i>&mdash;were
poems, beautiful, serious, colorful.</p>

<p>After these preliminaries one is prepared to find work done
with excess of care, with precision and balance, and, moreover,
to find color in its literal sense, poetic atmosphere and poetic
phrasing, scientific truth too, nature studied as Thoreau studied
it, and Burroughs. The six stories in <i>Flute and Violin</i> stand by
themselves in American literature. They are not perfect examples
of the short story judged by the latest canons. They make
often too much of the natural background, they lack in swiftness,
and they do not culminate with dramatic force. They are
poetic, at times almost lyrical. Open, for instance, <i>A Kentucky
Cardinal</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>March has gone like its winds. The other night as I lay awake with
that yearning which often beats within, there fell from the upper air
the notes of the wild gander as he wedged his way onward by faith,
not by sight, towards his distant bourn. I rose and, throwing open
the shutters, strained eyes toward the unseen and unseeing explorer,
startled, as a half-asleep soldier might be startled by the faint bugle-call
of his commander, blown to him from the clouds. What far-off
lands, streaked with mortal dawn, does he believe in? In what soft
sylvan waters will he bury his tired breast? Always when I hear his
voice, often when not, I too desire to be up and gone out of these
earthly marshes where hunts the dark Fowler&mdash;gone to some vast,
pure, open sea, where, one by one, my scattered kind, those whom I
love and those who love me, will arrive in safety, there to be together.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">One thinks of Thoreau&mdash;one thinks of him often as one reads
Allen. Everywhere Nature, and Nature with the metaphysical
light upon it. And connected with Nature always the tragedy
of human life&mdash;beauty of landscape expressed in perfect beauty
of language, but under it and behind it struggle and passion and
pain. Nowhere else in the period such distinction of expression,
such charm of literary atmosphere, combined with such
deep soundings into the heart of human life. "The White
Cowl" which appeared in the <i>Century</i> of 1888 and later "Sister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
Dolorosa" may be compared with no other American work later
than "Ethan Brand."</p>

<p>In his first period Allen was distinctively a writer of short
stories and sketches. His canvas was small, his plots single
and uncomplicated, his backgrounds over-elaborate, impeding
the movement of the plot and overshadowing the characters.
His art began with landscape&mdash;his second book, much of the
matter of which was written before the contents of the first, was
wholly landscape, landscape idealized and made lyric. Then
came <i>John Gray</i>, a preliminary sketch, and <i>A Kentucky Cardinal</i>
and its sequel <i>Aftermath</i>, long and short stories, parables,
humanity beginning to emerge from the vast cosmic nature spectacle
and to dominate. Over everything beauty, yet through it
all a strain of sadness, the sadness of youth repressed, of tragedy
too soon.</p>

<p>The second period began in 1896 with the publication of <i>Summer
in Arcady</i>. The novelist had moved permanently to New
York City. He had gained a broader outlook; he had felt the
new forces that were moving Thomas Hardy and the French
novelists. His early work seemed to him now narrow and weak,
mere exercises of a prentice hand. He would work with the
novel now rather than with the short story; he would deal with
broad canvas, with the great fundamental problems that complicate
human life. His essay in the <i>Atlantic</i> of October, 1897,
explains the new period in his work. Literature even into the
mid-nineties had been feminine rather than masculine, he
averred. The American novelists had aimed too much at refinement.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They sought the coverts where some of the more delicate elements of
our national life escaped the lidless eye of publicity, and paid their
delicate tributes to these; on the clumsy canvases of our tumultuous
democracy they watched to see where some solitary being or group of
beings described lines of living grace, and with grace they detached
these and transferred them to the enduring canvases of letters; they
found themselves impelled to look for the minute things of our humanity,
and having gathered these, to polish them, carve them, compose
them into minute structures with minutest elaboration ... polishing
and adornment of the little things of life&mdash;little ideas, little emotions,
little states of mind and shades of feeling, climaxes and dénouements,
little comedies and tragedies played quite through or not quite played
through by little men and women on the little stage of little playhouses.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span></p>

<p class="in0">So much for the past, for the feminine age to which his own
earlier work had belonged. A new age had arisen; a masculine
age, less delicate, less refined, less heedful of little things, a
strenuous age, more passionate and virile, less shrinking and
squeamish.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is striking out boldly for larger things&mdash;larger areas of adventure,
larger spaces of history, with freer movements through both: it
would have the wings of a bird in the air, and not the wings of a bird
on a woman's hat. It reveals a disposition to place its scenery, its
companies of players, and the logic of its dramas, not in rare, pale,
half-lighted, dimly beheld backgrounds, but nearer to the footlights of
the obvious. And if, finally, it has any one characteristic more discernible
than another, it is the movement away from the summits of
life downward towards the bases of life; from the heights of civilization
to the primitive springs of action; from the thin-aired regions of
consciousness which are ruled over by Tact to the underworld of
consciousness where are situated the mighty workshops, and where toils
on forever the cyclopean youth, Instinct.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was more than the analysis of a far-seeing critic: it was
the call of a novelist to himself to abandon the small ideals and
narrow field of his early art, and strike out into the main currents
of the age.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Let us try for a while the literary virtues and the literary materials
of less self-consciousness, of larger self-abandonment, and thus impart
to our fiction the free, the uncaring, the tremendous fling and swing
that are the very genius of our time and spirit.</p></blockquote>

<p>Following this declaration came the three major novels, <i>The
Choir Invisible</i>, which was his old short story <i>John Gray</i> enlarged
and given "fling and swing," <i>The Reign of Law</i>, and
<i>The Mettle of the Pasture</i>, novels of the type which he had denominated
masculine, American, yet to be grouped with nothing
else in American literature, their only analogues being found
in England or France.</p>

<p>In all his work he had been, as he had promised in his essay
on "Local Color," essentially scientific in spirit, but now he became
direct, fearless, fundamental. Nature he made central
now. The older art had made of it a background, a thing apart
from humanity, sometimes sympathetic, sometimes indifferent,
but Allen, like Hardy and his school, made of it now a ruling
force, a dominating personality in the tragedy. The first title<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
of <i>Summer in Arcady</i> as it ran serially in the <i>Cosmopolitan</i> was
<i>Butterflies: a Tale of Nature</i>. Its theme was the compelling
laws within human life: instincts, inheritances, physical forces
that bind beyond power to escape. Man is not to be treated as
apart from Nature but as inseparably a part of Nature, hurled
on by forces that he does not understand, ruled all unknowingly
by heredity, fighting senseless battles that, could he but know
all, would reduce life to a succession of ironies: "If Daphne
had but known, hidden away on one of those yellow sheets [on
which her own runaway marriage had just been recorded, the
last of a long series of such marriages] were the names of her
own father and mother."</p>

<p>In these later novels one finds now fully developed an element
that had been latent in all of his early work&mdash;a mystic symbolism
that in many ways is peculiar to Allen. <i>Summer in Arcady</i> is
built up around a parallelism that extends into every part of
the story:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Can you consider a field of butterflies and not think of the blindly
wandering, blindly loving, quickly passing human race? Can you
observe two young people at play on the meadows of Life and Love
without seeing in them a pair of these brief moths of the sun?</p></blockquote>

<p>And <i>The Reign of Law</i> is a parable from beginning to end,
a linking of man to Nature, a parallelism between human life
and the life of the hemp of the Kentucky fields:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Ah! type, too, of our life, which also is earth-sown, earth-rooted;
which must struggle upward, be cut down, rooted and broken, ere the
separation take place between our dross and our worth&mdash;poor perishable
shard and immortal fiber. Oh, the mystery, the mystery of that
growth from the casting of the soul as a seed into the dark earth,
until the time when, led through all natural changes and cleansed of
weakness, it is borne from the field of its nativity for the long service.</p></blockquote>

<p>All of his work is essentially timeless and placeless. He
had had from the first little in common with the other short
story writers of locality. Of dialect he has almost none; of
the negro who so dominates Southern literature he shows only
a glimpse in one or two of his earlier sketches. His background,
to be sure, is always Kentucky and this background he describes
with minuteness, but there is no attempt to portray personalities
or types peculiar to the State. He is working rather in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
realm of human life. Always is he tremendously serious. A
lambent humor may play here and there over the tales, but
everywhere is there the feeling of coming tragedy. Too much
concerned he is, perhaps, with the conception of sex as the central
problem of life&mdash;<i>Summer in Arcady</i> and <i>The Mettle of the
Pasture</i> were greeted with storms of disapproval&mdash;but one feels
that he is sincere, that he stands always on scientific grounds,
and that he is telling what he conceives to be the undiminished
truth about modern life.</p>

<p>And his solution, so far as he offers a solution, is free from
bitterness or pessimism. He is superior to Hardy inasmuch as
he is able to rise above the pagan standpoint and see the end
of the suffering and the irony crowned with ultimate good.
John Gray in <i>The Choir Invisible</i> summed up the philosophy
of the author in sentences like these: "To lose faith in men,
not in humanity; to see justice go down and not to believe in
the triumph of injustice; for every wrong that you weakly deal
another or another deals you to love more and more the fairness
and beauty of what is right, and so to turn the ever-increasing
love from the imperfection that is in us all to the Perfection that
is above us all&mdash;the perfection that is God: this is one of the
ideals of actual duty that you once said were to be as candles
in my hand. Many a time this candle has gone out; but as
quickly as I could snatch any torch&mdash;with your sacred name on
my lips&mdash;it has been relighted."</p>

<p>The volume of his writings is small. He has worked always
slowly, revising, rewriting, never satisfied. His earlier short
stories are perhaps his most perfect work; his longer short
stories, like <i>A Kentucky Cardinal</i>, his most charming; and his
later novels like <i>The Mettle of the Pasture</i>, his most enduring,
inasmuch as they contain the chief substance of what he had to
say to his generation. His weakness has been a fondness for
elaboration: in <i>The Reign of Law</i> a chapter is given to the life
history of the hemp plant and to a parallelism between it and
human life. The movement of his stories is constantly impeded
by what is really extraneous material, endless descriptions of
landscape, beautiful in itself but needless, and unnecessary
episodes: a cougar "gaunt with famine and come for its kill"
is creeping up to John Gray, who is weaponless, but before the
final spring four pages about the habits of the animal&mdash;a chapter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
altogether for the adventure, and after it is all told it is
"lumber" so far as the needs of the novel are concerned.</p>

<p>But there is a more fundamental weakness: his work on the
whole is the product of a follower rather than a leader. He
learned his art deliberately impelled not by a voice within which
demanded expression but by a love for beautiful things and a
dogged determination to win in the field that he had chosen for
his life work. By interminable toil and patience, and by alertness
to seize upon every new development in his art, he made
himself at last a craftsman of marvelous skill, even of brilliancy.
He was not a voice in the period; rather was he an artisan with
a sure hand, a craftsman with exquisite skill.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The triumph of the short story came in the early nineties.
In the September, 1891, issue of <i>Harper's Monthly</i> Mr. Howells,
reviewing Garland's <i>Main-Traveled Roads</i>, commented on the
fact that collections of stories from the magazines were competing
on even terms with the novels:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We do not know how it has happened; we should not at all undertake
to say; but it is probably attributable to a number of causes. It
may be the prodigious popularity of Mr. Kipling which has broken
down all prejudices against the form of his success. The vogue that
Maupassant's tales in the original or in versions have enjoyed may
have had something to do with it. Possibly the critical recognition of
the American supremacy in this sort has helped. But however it has
come about, it is certain that the result has come, and the publishers
are fearlessly venturing volumes of short stories on every hand; and
not only short stories by authors of established repute, but by new
writers who would certainly not have found this way to the public
some time ago.</p></blockquote>

<p>During this decade the short story reached its highest level.
In February, 1892, the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> in a review of current
collections of short stories by Thomas Nelson Page, Joel Chandler
Harris, James Lane Allen, Octave Thanet, Hamlin Garland,
Richard Harding Davis, Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, Rose Terry
Cooke, George A. Hibbard, William Douglas O'Connor, Clinton
Ross, Thomas A. Janvier, H.&nbsp;C. Bunner, Brander Matthews, and
Frank R. Stockton, remarked of the form that "in America it
is the most vital as well as the most distinctive part of literature.
In fact, it flourishes so amply that this very prosperity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
nullifies most of the apologies for the American novel." But
even within the limits of the decade of its fullest success came
the decline. The enormous vogue of the form resulted in the
journalization of it. O. Henry with his methods helped greatly
to devitalize and cheapen it. With him the short story became
fictional vaudeville. Everywhere a straining for effect, a
search for the piquant and the startling. He is theatric, stagy,
smart, ultra modern. Instead of attempts at truth a succession
of smart hits: "The wind out of the mountains was singing
like a jew's-harp in a pile of old tomato-cans by the railroad
track"; "A bullet-headed man Smith was, with an oblique, dead
eye and the mustache of a cocktail mixer," etc. He is flippant,
insincere, with an eye to the last sentence which must startle
the reader until he gasps. After O. Henry the swift decline of
the short story, the inclusion of it in correspondence courses, and
the reign of machine-made art.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>But during the decade of the high tide came some of the
strongest work in American literature. It was the period of the
earlier and better work of Hamlin Garland and Alice French, of
Richard Harding Davis and Ambrose Bierce, of Mrs. Deland and
F.&nbsp;H. Smith, with Garland, perhaps, the most distinctive worker.
Garland began as an iconoclast, a leader of the later phase of
realism&mdash;depressed realism after the Russian and the French
types. His little book of essays, <i>Crumbling Idols</i>, breezy and
irreverent, with its cry for a new Americanism in our literature,
new truth, new realism, was the voice of the new generation
after Harte and Howells, the school inspired by Ibsen, Hardy,
Tolstoy, Maupassant. The Middle West was his background and
he knew it with completeness. He had been born in a Wisconsin
"coulé" on a ragged, half-broken farm, and before he
was eleven he had migrated with his parents westward, three
different times. His boyhood had followed the middle western
border. The father was of Maine Yankee stock, full of the restlessness
and eagerness of his generation. In his son's record he
stands out in almost epic proportions.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Hour after hour we pushed westward, the heads of our tired horses
hanging ever lower, and on my mother's face the shadow deepened, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
my father's voice calling to his team lost nothing of its edge. He was
in his element. He loved this shelterless sweep of sod. This westward
march delighted him. I think he would have gladly kept on until
he reached the Rocky <span class="locked">Mountains.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>He had stopped this time in Iowa and had begun once again
the tremendous task of making a farm out of the virgin prairie.
The boy took his full share of work. Speaking of himself in the
third person, he says: "In the autumn that followed his eleventh
birthday he plowed for seventy days, overturning nearly
one hundred and fifty acres of stubble." At fifteen he was
head farmer and took a man's place on the reaper, at the threshing,
and in all of the farm work. Education came to him as he
could get it. He attended the winter sessions of the district
school and he read all the books that the neighborhood afforded.
By rarest good fortune his father subscribed for the new <i>Hearth
and Home</i> in which the serial <i>The Hoosier Schoolmaster</i> was
running, and in the boy's own words in later years the story
was a "milestone in his literary progress as it was in the development
of distinctive Western fiction."</p>

<p>His later struggles toward culture, his graduation in 1881
from Cedar Valley Seminary, Osage, Iowa, his school teaching
in Illinois and Dakota, his experience as a settler during the
Dakota land "boom" of 1883, his Howells-like journey to Boston
the following year, and his years of life there as teacher and
eager student, must be passed over swiftly. He haunted the
Boston public library and read enormously, he became impressed
with the theories of the new French school of "Veritists," and
he soon began to write, first photographic sketches of Middle-Western
life&mdash;corn and wheat raising, rural customs, and the
like&mdash;then after a long period he returned West for his first vacation.
At Chicago he visited Joseph Kirkland (1830&ndash;1894),
author of <i>Zury: the Meanest Man in Spring County</i> (1887),
a book of crude yet strong pictures of Western life, and the call
was another milestone in his literary life.</p>

<p>The result of that vacation was three books of short stories,
their author's most distinctive work, <i>Main-Traveled Roads</i>,
<i>Prairie Folks</i>, and <i>Other Main-Traveled Roads</i>. His own account
of the matter is worthy of quotation:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The entire series was the result of a summer-vacation visit to my
old home in Iowa, to my father's farm in Dakota, and, last of all, to
my birthplace in Wisconsin. This happened in 1887. I was living
at the time in Boston, and had not seen the West for several years,
and my return to the scenes of my boyhood started me upon a series
of stories delineative of farm and village life as I knew it and had
lived it. I wrote busily during the two years that followed, and in
this revised definitive edition of <i>Main-Traveled Roads</i> and its companion
volume, <i>Other Main-Traveled Roads</i> (compiled from other volumes
which now go out of print), the reader will find all of the short
stories which came from my pen between 1887 and 1889.</p>

<p>It remains to say that, though conditions have changed somewhat
since that time, yet for the hired man and the renter farm life in the
West is still a stern round of drudgery. My pages present it&mdash;not as
the summer boarder or the young lady novelist sees it&mdash;but as the
working farmer endures it.</p></blockquote>

<p>After the years at Boston the life of his native region had
taken on for him a totally new aspect. He saw it now as Howard
saw it in "Up the Coulé," the grinding toil of it, the brutality
and hopelessness and horror of it, and it filled him with fierce
anger. He wrote with full heart and with an earnestness that
was terrible, and he had the courage of his convictions. Will
Hannan takes Agnes from the hell into which she has married
and bears her into his own new home of love and helpfulness and
there is no apology, and again the same theme in later tales.
There is the grimness and harshness and unsparing fidelity to
fact, however unpleasant, that one finds in the Russian realists,
but there is another element added to it: the fervor and faith
of the reformer. Such a story as "Under the Lion's Paw," for
instance, does not leave one, like Ibsen and Hardy, in despair
and darkness; it arouses rather to anger and the desire to take
action harsh and immediate. There is no dodging of facts. All
the dirt and coarseness of farm life come into the picture and
often dominate it. The author is not writing poetry; despite his
<i>Prairie Songs</i> he is no poet. Howard is visiting home after a
long absence:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It was humble enough&mdash;a small white story-and-a-half structure,
with a wing set in the midst of a few locust trees; a small drab-colored
barn with a sagging ridge-pole; a barnyard full of mud, in which a
few cows were standing, fighting the flies and waiting to be milked.
An old man was pumping water at the well; the pigs were squealing
from a pen near by; a child was crying....</p>

<p>As he waited, he could hear a woman's fretful voice, and the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>impatient
jerk and jar of kitchen things, indicative of ill-temper or worry.
The longer he stood absorbing this farm-scene, with all its sordidness,
dullness, triviality, and its endless drudgeries, the lower his heart sank.
All the joy of the home-coming was gone, when the figure arose from
the cow and approached the gate, and put the pail of milk down on
the platform by the pump.</p>

<p>"Good-evening," said Howard, out of the dusk.</p>

<p>Grant stared a moment. "Good-evening."</p>

<p>Howard knew the voice, though it was older and deeper and more
sullen. "Don't you know me, Grant? I am Howard."</p>

<p>The man approached him, gazing intently at his face. "You are?"
after a pause. "Well, I'm glad to see you, but I can't shake hands.
That damned cow has laid down in the mud."</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">But the most pitiful pictures are those of the women. Lucretia
Burns is a type:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>She had no shawl or hat and no shoes, for it was still muddy in the
little yard, where the cattle stood patiently fighting the flies and mosquitoes
swarming into their skins, already wet with blood. The evening
was oppressive with its heat, and a ring of just-seen thunder-heads
gave premonitions of an approaching storm.</p>

<p>She arose from the cow's side at last, and, taking her pails of foaming
milk, staggered toward the gate. The two pails hung from her
lean arms, her bare feet slipped on the filthy ground, her greasy and
faded calico dress showed her tired and swollen ankles, and the mosquitoes
swarmed mercilessly on her neck and bedded themselves in her
colorless hair.</p>

<p>The children were quarreling at the well, and the sound of blows
could be heard. Calves were querulously calling for their milk, and
little turkeys, lost in a tangle of grass, were piping plaintively.</p>

<p>It was a pitifully worn, almost tragic face&mdash;long, thin, sallow, hollow-eyed.
The mouth had long since lost the power to shape itself
into a kiss, and had a droop at the corners which seemed to announce
a breaking-down at any moment into a despairing wail. The collarless
neck and sharp shoulders showed painfully.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is the tragic world of Mary E. Wilkins&mdash;her obstinate, elemental,
undemonstrative rustics moved into a new setting. As
in her work, simplicity, crude force, the power of one who for
a moment has forgotten art and gives the feeling of actual life,
verisimilitude that convinces and compels. The little group of
stories is work sent hot from a man's heart, and they are alive
as are few other stories of the period, and they will live. They
are part of the deeper history of a section and an era.</p>

<p>This element of purpose is found in all of Garland's work.
Nowhere is he a mere teller of tales. The Scotch and Yankee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
elements within him made of him a preacher, a man with a
message. The narrow field of his first success could not long
be worked, and, like the true son of a pioneer, he began to follow
his old neighbors in their further migrations westward. His
later work took the form of novels, many of them dealing with
the extreme West and all of them saturated with purpose. His
<i>Captain of the Gray Horse Troop</i>, for instance, attempted for
the Indian what <i>Ramona</i> tried to do. It is a powerful study
of the wrongs done a race, and, moreover, it is a novel. Still
later the native mysticism of his race showed itself in such novels
as <i>The Tyranny of the Dark</i>, <i>The Shadow World</i>, <i>Victor
Ollnee's Discipline</i>&mdash;spiritualistic propaganda.</p>

<p>With the novel he has not fully succeeded. He lacks power
of construction and ability for extended effort. The short story
"A Branch Road" in <i>Main-Traveled Roads</i> has a gripping power,
but the same theme treated at novel length in <i>Moccasin Ranch</i>
becomes too much an exploiting of background. There is a sense
of dilution, a loss of effect. The author's first fine edge of anger,
of conviction, of complete possession by his material, is gone, and
we have the feeling that he has become a professional man of
letters, an exploiter of what he considers to be salable material.
His best long novel is <i>Rose of Dutcher's Coolly</i>. <i>Money Magic</i>
has a certain sense of power connected with it, but it lacks the
final touch of actual life. Unlike <i>The Rise of Silas Lapham</i>,
with which it may be compared, it leaves us unsatisfied. The
quivering sense of reality that one finds in <i>Main-Traveled Roads</i>
is not there. It is a performance, a brilliant picture made deliberately
and coldly by a man in his study, whereas a story
like "Among the Corn Rows" reads as if it had taken possession
of its author, and had been written with a burst of creative
enthusiasm. One late fragment of Garland's must not be overlooked,
his <i>A Son of the Middle Border</i>, a part of which has
appeared in serial form. It is an autobiography, and it is more:
it is a document in the history of the Middle West. It has a
value above all his novels, above all else that he has written,
saving always those tense short stories of his first inspiration.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The Western stories of Alice French antedated by several years
Garland's first work and perhaps had an influence upon it. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
strong story "The Bishop's Vagabond" appeared in the <i>Atlantic</i>
as early as 1884 and her collection <i>Knitters in the Sun</i> by Octave
Thanet came out in 1887. Her work, however, has not the originality
and the sharpness of outline of Garland's and it has
failed to hold the high place that was at first assigned to it.
She is to be classed with Miss Woolson rather than with Mrs.
Wilkins Freeman, with Miss Murfree rather than with Harris.
She was not a native of the regions she chose as her literary field,
but she entered them with curiosity and studied their peculiarities
carefully with open note-book for Northern readers.</p>

<p>Her father and her brothers were extensive manufacturers,
and contact with their work gave her a knowledge of labor conditions
and of economic problems that enabled her in the early
eighties to contribute to the <i>Atlantic</i> and other magazines able
papers, such as "The Indoor Pauper" and "Contented Masses,"
papers widely commented upon for their brilliancy and breadth
of view. But the success won everywhere by the feminine short
story writers tempted her from these economic studies, and for
a time she wrote local color tales with variety of background&mdash;Canada,
Florida, Iowa. Then, with ample means at her disposal,
she built at Clover Bend, Arkansas, a summer home on the banks
of the Black River, and, like Miss Murfree, became interested in
the crude social conditions about her, so different from those of
her native New England or her adopted Iowa city of Davenport.
Stories like "Whitsun Harp, Regulator" and "Ma'
Bowlin'" followed, then the fine studies entitled "Plantation
Life in Arkansas" and "Town Life in Arkansas."</p>

<p>These earlier stories are often dramatic, even melodramatic,
and they abound in sentiment. Sometimes a character stands
out with sharpness, but more often the tale impresses one as a
performance rather than a bit of actual life. The intense feeling
that Garland, who wrote as if his material came from out
his own bitter heart, throws into his stories she does not have.
She stands as an outsider and looks on with interest and takes
notes, often graphic notes, then displays her material as an exhibitor
sets forth his curious collection.</p>

<p>More and more the sociological specialist and the reformer
took control of her pen. Even her short stories are not free
from special pleading: "Convict Number 49," for instance, is
not so much a story as a tract for the times. In her novels the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
problem dominates. <i>The Man of the Hour</i> and <i>The Lion's
Share</i> treat phases of the labor problem, and <i>By Inheritance</i> is
a study of the negro question with an attempted solution. The
story, despite dramatic intensity at times and lavish sentiment,
fails often to interest the reader unless he be a sociologist or
a reformer. Already she holds her place by reason of a few
of her earlier short stories, and it would seem that even these
are now losing the place that once undoubtedly was theirs.</p>

<p>More convincing, though perhaps they have had smaller influence
upon their time, have been the Vermont stories of Rowland
E. Robinson, which are genuine at every point and full of
subtle humor, and the Adirondack stories of Philander Deming,
which began to appear in the <i>Atlantic</i> in the mid-seventies.
Both men have written out of their own lives with full hearts,
and both have added to their material a touch of originality
that has made it distinctive.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>In tracing the development of the short story to the end of
the century one must pause at the exquisite work of H.&nbsp;C. Bunner,
who undoubtedly did much toward bringing the form to
mechanical perfection. His volume entitled <i>Made in France:
French Tales with a U.&nbsp;S. Twist</i>, suggests one secret of his art.
He had a conciseness, a brilliancy of effect, an epigrammatic
touch, that suggest the best qualities of French style. In his
volumes <i>Short Sixes</i> and <i>More Short Sixes</i> he is at his best&mdash;humorous,
artistic, effective, and in addition he touches at times
the deeper strata of human life and becomes an interpreter and
a leader.</p>

<p>French in effect also is Ambrose Bierce, who in his earlier
work displayed a power to move his readers that is little found
outside of Poe. Reserve he has, a directness that at times is
disconcerting, originality of a peculiar type, and a command
of many of the subtlest elements of the story-telling art, but
lacking sincerity, he fails of permanent appeal. He writes for
effect, for startling climax, for an insidious attack upon his
reader's nerves, and often, as in his collection entitled <i>In the
Midst of Life</i>, he works his will. But he is not true, he works
not in human life as it is actually lived, but in a Poe-like life that
exists only in his own imaginings. In his later years journalism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
took the fine edge from his art and adverse criticism of his
work turned him into something like a literary anarchist who
criticized with bitterness all things established. A few of his
novels may be studied with profit as models of their kind, but
the greater part of his writings despite their brilliancy can not
hope for permanence.</p>

<p>One may close the survey with Richard Harding Davis, who
may be taken as the typical figure of the last years of the century.
Davis was a journalist, peculiarly and essentially a journalist.
He began his career in a newspaper office and all that
he did was colored by the newspaper atmosphere. Literature
to him was a thing to be dashed off with facility, to be read with
excitement, and to be thrown aside. The art of making it he
learned as one learns any other profession, by careful study and
painstaking thoroughness, and having mastered it he became a
literary practitioner, expert in all branches.</p>

<p>"Gallagher" was his first story, and it was a brilliant production,
undoubtedly his best. Then followed the Van Bibber
stories, facile studies of the idle rich area of New York life of
which the author was a mere spectator, remarkable only for the
influence they exerted on younger writers. Of the rest of his
voluminous output little need be said. It is ephemeral, it was
made to supply the demand of the time for amusement. With
O. Henry, Edward W. Townsend of the "Chimmie Fadden"
stories, and others, its author debauched the short story and
made it the mere thing of a day, a bit of journalism to be
thrown aside with the paper that contained it. On the mechanical
side one may find but little fault. As a performance it is
often brilliant, full of dash and spirit and excessive modernness,
but it lacks all the elements that make for permanence&mdash;beauty
of style, distinction of phrase, and, most of all, fidelity to the
deeper truths of life. It imparts to its reader little save a momentary
titillation and the demand for more. It deals only
with the superficial and the coarsely attractive, and we feel it
is so because of its author's limitations, because he knows little
of the deeps of character, of sacrifice, of love in the genuine
sense, of the fundamental stuff of which all great literature has
been woven. He is the maker of extravaganzas, of Zenda romances,
of preposterous combinations like <i>A Soldier of Fortune</i>,
which is true neither to human nature nor to any possibility of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
terrestrial geography; he is a special correspondent with facile
pen who tells nothing new and nothing authoritative&mdash;a man
of the mere to-day, and with the mere to-day he will be forgotten.
Were he but an isolated case such criticism were unnecessary;
he might be omitted from our study; but he is the
type of a whole school, a school indeed that bids fair to exert
enormous influence upon the literature, especially upon the fiction,
of the period that is to come.</p>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Thus the fiction of the period has expressed itself prevailingly
in short-breathed work. Compared with the fiction of France
or England or Russia, with the major work of Balzac or Thackeray
or Tolstoy, it has been a thing of seeming fragments. Instead
of writing "the great American novel," which was so
eagerly looked for during all the period, its novelists have preferred
to cultivate small social areas and to treat even these by
means of brief sketches.</p>

<p>The reasons are obvious. American life during the period
was so heterogeneous, so scattered, that it has been impossible
to comprehend any large part of it in a single study. The novelist
who would express himself prevailingly in the larger units
of fiction, like Henry James, for instance, or F. Marion Crawford,
has been forced to take his topics from European life. The
result has been narrowness, cameos instead of canvases, short
stories rather than novels. In a period that over enormous
areas was transforming thousands of discordant elements into
what was ultimately to be a unity, nothing else was possible.
Short stories were almost imperative. He who would deal with
crude characters in a bare environment can not prolong his story
without danger of attenuation. The failure of Miss Murfree,
and indeed of nearly all of the short story writers when they
attempted to expand their compressed and carefully wrought
tales into novels, has already been dwelt upon.</p>

<p>But shortness of unit is not a fault. The brevity of the form,
revealing as it does with painful conspicuousness all inferior
elements, has resulted in an excellence of workmanship that has
made the American short story the best art form of its kind to
be found in any literature. The richness of the materials used
has also raised the quality of the output. The picturesqueness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
of American life during the period has made possible themes
of absorbing interest and unusual vividness of picturing, and
the elemental men and passions found in new and isolated areas
have furnished abundance of material for characterization.
Until the vast field of American life becomes more unified and
American society becomes less a matter of provincial varieties,
the short story will continue to be the unit of American fiction.</p>

<span class="subhead">SHIFTING CURRENTS OF FICTION</span></h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>In 1870 American fiction ran in two currents: fiction of the
<i>Atlantic</i> type, read by the cultivated few, and fiction of Bonner's
<i>New York Ledger</i> type, read openly by the literate masses
and surreptitiously by many others. There was also a very
large class of readers that read no novels at all. Puritanism
had frowned upon fiction, the church generally discountenanced
it, and in many places prejudice ran deep. George Cary Eggleston
in the biography of his brother has recorded his own
experience:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It will scarcely be believed by many in the early years of the twentieth
century, that as late as the end of the third quarter of the nineteenth,
there still survived a bitter prejudice against novels as demoralizing
literature, and that even short stories were looked upon with
doubt and suspicion.... When <i>The Hoosier Schoolmaster</i> began to
appear, a member of the publishing house was sorely troubled. He
had been a bitter and vehement opponent of novels and novel reading.
He had published articles of his own in denunciation of fiction and in
rebuke of his friends in a great publishing house for putting forth
literature of that character. He now began to suspect that <i>The
Hoosier Schoolmaster</i> was in fact a novel, and he was shocked at the
thought that it was appearing in a periodical published by himself....
When the story was about to appear in book form Edward
wrote "A Novel" as a sub-title, and the publisher referred to was again
in a state of nervous agitation. He could in no wise consent to proclaim
himself as a publisher of novels. In view of the large advance
orders for the book he was eager to publish the novel, but he could
not reconcile himself to the open admission that it was a <span class="locked">novel.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>While <i>The Bread-Winners</i> was running its anonymous course
in the <i>Century</i> in 1884, its author, now known to have been John
Hay, felt called upon to issue an explanatory note:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am engaged in business in which my standing would be seriously
compromised if it were known I had written a novel. I am sure that
my practical efficiency is not lessened by this act, but I am equally
sure that I could never recover from the injury it would occasion me
if known among my own colleagues. For that positive reason, and
for the negative one that I do not care for publicity, I resolved to keep
the knowledge of my little venture in authorship restricted to as small
a circle as possible. Only two persons besides myself know who wrote
<i>The Bread-Winners</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>The final breaking down of this prejudice and the building
up of the new clientele of readers that at length gave prose fiction
its later enormous vogue is one of the most interesting
phenomena of the period. The novel gained its present respectability
as a literary form by what may be called an artifice.
It came in disguised as moral instruction, as character-building
studies of life, as historical narrative, as reform propaganda.
<i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>, which had been read by thousands who had
never opened a novel before, had begun the work. <i>The Hoosier
Schoolmaster</i> was allowed to appear in the columns of <i>Hearth
and Home</i> because it was a moral tale for children and because
it was written by a minister whose motives no one could question.
So with the works of the Rev. E.&nbsp;P. Roe, and the stories
of Dr. J.&nbsp;G. Holland, who had gained an enormous following
with his series of lay sermons published under the name of
Timothy Titcomb.</p>

<p>Perhaps Dr. Holland, more than any other writer of the time,
is responsible for this rehabilitation of the novel. He understood
the common people. His own origin had been humble&mdash;the
son of a mechanic of western Massachusetts, blessed with
poverty, educated through his own efforts, enabled after a long
struggle to take a medical diploma&mdash;educator, school teacher,
superintendent of schools in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and finally,
under Samuel Bowles, assistant editor of the Springfield, Massachusetts,
<i>Republican</i>, which, largely through his efforts, arose to
national importance. He was forty when the Timothy Titcomb
letters entered upon their enormous popularity&mdash;it is estimated
that nearly half a million copies of the series were sold first and
last; he was fifty when he established <i>Scribner's Monthly</i> and
assumed its editorship.</p>

<p><i>Scribner's</i> under his direction became for the new period
what the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> had been for the period before. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
was a moralist, a plain man of the people, and he knew his
clientele; he knew the average American reader that makes up
the great democratic mass, the reader who had bought <i>The Wide,
Wide World</i>, and <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>, and the <i>Titcomb Letters</i>.
He gave them first of all a serial novel by the Rev. George MacDonald,
and he printed at the close of the first volume of the
<i>Monthly</i> a letter from a reader, sample of thousands which had
filled his mail. Here is an extract:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I know of no writings better calculated than his [MacDonald's] to
draw out what is noble and true in the reader, or call forth fine feelings
and high resolves. They give impulse to life. We come away from
reading one of his books stronger and better prepared for our life-work.
Is not this the surest test of excellence in a book?</p></blockquote>

<p>It was this purpose that inspired his own fiction, <i>Arthur
Bonnicastle</i>, <i>Nicholas Minturn</i>, and the others, earnest, moral
tales sprinkled freely with sentiment, wholesome, but not high
in literary merit. No other man did so much to direct the
period into the well-known channels which it took. His whole
influence was democratic. He would publish literature for the
people, and to him literature was a serious thing, the voice of
life. The group of new authors which he gathered about him
is comparable only with the group that James T. Fields gathered
about himself in the earlier golden days of the <i>Atlantic</i>.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The period of moralizing fiction culminated with the work of
the Rev. Edward Payson Roe, whose first novel, <i>Barriers Burned
Away</i> (1872), with its background of the great Chicago fire, and
its tense moral atmosphere which skilfully concealed its sensationalism
and its plentiful sentiment, became enormously
popular. When its author died in 1888 his publishers estimated
that 1,400,000 copies of all his novels had been sold, not counting
pirated editions in many foreign languages, and the sale of
the books has been steady up to the present time.</p>

<p>Roe, like Holland, had sprung from the common people and
had been largely self-educated. For a time he had attended
Williams College, Massachusetts, he had enlisted for the war as
the chaplain of a regiment, and after the war had settled down
as pastor of the First Church at Highland Falls, New York.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
After nine years his health failed him and he betook himself
to an out-of-doors life, fruit raising at Cornwall-on-Hudson,
and his experience he embodied in several practical handbooks
like <i>Success with Small Fruits</i>, first published serially in <i>Scribner's</i>.
The last years of his life he gave to fiction, turning it
out with facility and in quantity and always with the theory
that he was thereby continuing his work as a pastor. "My
books," he wrote, "are read by thousands; my voice reached at
most but a few hundred. My object in writing, as in preaching,
is to do good; and the question is, Which can I do best? I think
with the pen, and I shall go on writing no matter what the critics
<span class="locked">say."<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>That his novels are lacking in the higher elements of literary
art, in structure and style and creative imagination, is apparent
even to the uncritical, but that they are lacking in truth to life
and power to move the reader no one can declare. At every
point they are wholesome and manly. Roe's assertion that he
worked with reverence in the fundamental stuff of life one must
admit or else deny his contention that, "The chief evidence of
life in a novel is the fact that it <span class="locked">lives."<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></span> Surely it must be
admitted that few novels of the period have shown more vitality.</p>

<p>His influence has been considerable. With Holland and his
school he helped greatly in the building up of that mass of novel
readers, mostly women it must be said, which by the middle of
the eighties had reached such enormous proportions. He led
readers on to Lew Wallace's <i>The Fair God</i> and <i>Ben Hur</i>, and to
the novels of Frances Hodgson Burnett, who added to the conventional
devices of Holland and Roe&mdash;sentiment, sensation,
love-centered interest culminating inevitably in marriage at the
close of the story&mdash;literary art and a certain dramatic power.
She was realistic in method,&mdash;her <i>That Lass o' Lowrie's</i> (1877)
reproduced the Lancashire dialect in all its uncouthness&mdash;but the
atmosphere of her work was romantic. Her <i>Little Lord Fauntleroy</i>
(1886), unquestionably the most successful juvenile of the
period, has been described as "a fairy tale of real life." All of
her books, indeed, have this fairy tale basis. She has been exceedingly
popular, but she cannot be counted among the original
forces of the period. From her the current of popularity flowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
on to F. Marion Crawford's cosmopolitan work, to Margaret
Deland's strong problem novel <i>John Ward, Preacher</i>; then it
swelled into a flood with <i>David Harum</i> and the historical novels
that made notable the nineties. At the close of the century fiction
was read by all and in quantities that seem incredible.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>In a chapter which traces the growth of the novel, in distinction
from the growth of the sketch or the short story, F.
Marion Crawford must be given a leading place. Of all American
writers he devoted himself most fully to the major form of
fiction. He wrote forty-five novels, and few sketches and short
stories: he was a novelist and only a novelist. He appeared at
the one moment when the type of fiction which he represented
was most certain of wide recognition. His earliest book, <i>Mr.
Isaacs</i> (1882), dealt with a new, strange environment&mdash;India,
five years before Kipling made it his background; it had a religious
atmosphere&mdash;the mystic beliefs of the Orient; and it told
a story with sentiment and with dramatic movement. <i>Zoroaster</i>,
with its opening sentence, "The hall of the banquets was
made ready for the feast in the palace of Babylon," appealed
to an audience that had rated <i>Ben Hur</i> among the greatest of
novels.</p>

<p>But the earliest books of Crawford showed little of the main
current of his work. No two novelists could differ more radically
than he and Roe. To him the purpose-novel was a bastard
thing unworthy the powers of a true artist.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Lessons, lectures, discussions, sermons, and didactics generally belong
to institutions set apart for especial purposes and carefully avoided,
after a certain age, by the majority of those who wish to be amused.
The purpose-novel is an odious attempt to lecture people who hate lectures,
to preach to people who prefer their own church, and to
teach people who think they know enough already. It is an ambush,
a lying-in-wait for the unsuspecting public, a violation of the social
contract&mdash;and as such it ought to be either mercilessly crushed or
forced by law to bind itself in black and label itself "Purpose" in very
big <span class="locked">letters.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The office of the novel was, therefore, entertainment and only
entertainment. He has been the chief exponent in America of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
art for art's sake. A novel, he maintained, is a little "pocket-stage"
whose only office is to please.</p>

<p>The life and the training of Crawford gave him a viewpoint
which was singularly different from that held by the short story
writers who were so busily exploiting provincial little neighborhoods
in all the remote nooks and corners of the land. His
training had given him an outlook more cosmopolitan than even
that of Henry James. He had been born at Bagni-di-Lucca,
in Tuscany, son of Thomas Crawford the sculptor, and he had
spent the first eleven years of his life in Rome. Later he had
studied at Concord, New Hampshire; at Trinity College, Cambridge;
at Karlsruhe, at Heidelberg; and finally at Rome, where
he had specialized in the classics. In 1873 he was at Allahabad,
India, connected with the <i>Indian Herald</i>, and later on, his
health failing, he visited his uncle in New York, Samuel Ward,
brother of Julia Ward Howe, and at his advice threw some of
his Indian experiences into the form of fiction. The instant
success of <i>Mr. Isaacs</i> determined his career. After extensive
travels in Turkey and elsewhere, he settled down in Italy in a
picturesque villa overlooking the Bay of Naples, and there he
spent the remaining years of his life, years of enormous literary
productivity, and of growing popularity with readers both in
America and in Europe.</p>

<p>No other American novelist has ever covered so much of territory.
He wrote with first-hand knowledge of life in America,
in England, in Germany, in Italy, in Constantinople, and India,
and he wrote with scholarly accuracy historical novels dealing
with times and places as diverse as Persia in the times of
Zoroaster; as the second crusade&mdash;<i>Via Crucis</i>; as the era of
Philip II in Spain&mdash;<i>In the Palace of the King</i>; as Venice in the
Middle Ages&mdash;<i>Marietta, a Maid of Venice</i>; as early Arabia&mdash;<i>Kahled</i>;
and as early Constantinople&mdash;<i>Arethusa</i>.</p>

<p>The heart of his work undoubtedly is made up of the fifteen
novels that deal with life in Rome and its environs: <i>Saracinesca</i>,
<i>Sant' Ilario</i>, <i>Don Orsino</i>, <i>Taquisara</i>, <i>Corleone</i>, <i>Casa
Braccio</i>, <i>A Roman Singer</i>, <i>Marzio's Crucifix</i>, <i>Heart of Rome</i>,
<i>Cecilia</i>, <i>Whosoever Shall Offend</i>, <i>Pietro Ghisleri</i>, <i>To Leeward</i>,
<i>A Lady of Rome</i>, and <i>The White Sister</i>. The novels deal almost
exclusively with the middle and higher classes of Rome, classes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
of which most Americans know nothing at all, for, to quote from
the opening chapter of <i>To Leeward</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There are two Romes. There is the Rome of the intelligent foreigner,
consisting of excavations, monuments, tramways, hotels, typhoid
fever, incense, and wax candles; and there is the Rome within, a city
of antique customs, good and bad, a town full of aristocratic prejudices,
of intrigues, of religion, of old-fashioned honor and new-fashioned
scandal, of happiness and unhappiness, of just people and
unjust.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is this other half Rome, unknown to the casual tourist,
unknown to any not native born and Romanist in faith, that he
has shown us, as Howells attempted to show the social life of
Boston and New England, and as Cable sought to enter the heart
of Creole New Orleans. With what success? Those who know
most of Roman life have spoken with praise. He has given to
his aristocracy perhaps too much of charm, they say; too much
of inflexible will, it may be; too much of fire and fury; yet on
the whole he has been true to the complex life he has sought
to reproduce, truer, perhaps, than Howells has been to Boston
or Cable to New Orleans, for he has worked from the inside
as one native born, as one reared in the society he describes, even
to the detail of accepting its religious belief. One may well
believe it, for everywhere in the novels is the perfection of naturalness,
the atmosphere of reality.</p>

<p>With his seven stories of American life, <i>An American Politician</i>
and the others, he is less convincing. He wrote as a
foreigner, as an observer of the outward with no fullness of
sympathy, no depth of knowledge. He was European in viewpoint
and in experience, and he knew better the European background&mdash;Germany
as in <i>Greifenstein</i> and <i>The Cigarette-Maker's
Romance</i>, or England as in <i>The Tale of a Lonely Parish</i>, or even
Constantinople as in <i>Paul Patoff</i>.</p>

<p>He wins us first with his worldliness, his vast knowledge of
the surfaces of life in all lands. He is full of cosmopolitan
comparisons, wisdom from everywhere, modern instances from
Stamboul and Allahabad and Rome. To read him is like walking
through foreign scenes with a fully informed guide, a marvelous
guide, indeed, a patrician, a polished man of the world.
Everywhere in his work an atmosphere of good breeding&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>charming
people of culture and wideness of experience: diplomats,
artists, statesmen, noblemen, gentlemen of the world and
ladies indeed. There is no coarseness, no dialect, no uncouth
characters. We are in the world of wealth, of old-established
institutions, of traditions and social laws that are inflexible. In
the telling of the tale he has but a single purpose:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We are not poets, because we can not be. We are not genuine playwriters
for many reasons; chiefly, perhaps, because we are not clever
enough, since a successful play is incomparably more lucrative than
a successful novel. We are not preachers, and few of us would be
admitted to the pulpit. We are not, as a class, teachers or professors,
nor lawyers, nor men of business. We are nothing more than public
amusers. Unless we choose we need not be anything less. Let us, then,
accept our position cheerfully, and do the best we can to fulfil our
mission, without attempting to dignify it with titles too imposing for
it to bear, and without degrading it by bringing its productions down
even a little way, from the lowest level of high comedy to the highest
level of <span class="locked">buffoonery.<a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>From this standpoint he has succeeded to the full. He has
told his stories well; he holds his reader's interest to the end.
Slight though his stories may often be in development, they are
ingenious always in construction and they are cumulative in
interest. He has undoubted dramatic power, sparkling dialogue,
thrust and parry, whole novels like <i>Saracinesca</i>, for instance,
that might be transferred to the stage with scarcely an
alteration. His characters and episodes appeal to him always
from the dramatic side. The novel, indeed, as he defines it is
a species of drama:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It may fairly be claimed that humanity has, within the past hundred
years, found the way of carrying a theater in its pocket; and so long
as humanity remains what it is, it will delight in taking out its pocket-stage
and watching the antics of the actors, who are so like itself and
yet so much more interesting. Perhaps that is, after all, the best answer
to the question, "What is a novel?" It is, or ought to be, a
pocket-stage. Scenery, light, shade, the actors themselves, are made
of words, and nothing but words, more or less cleverly put together.
A play is good in proportion as it represents the more dramatic, passionate,
romantic, or humorous sides of real life. A novel is excellent
according to the degree in which it produces the illusions of a good
play&mdash;but it must not be forgotten that the play is the thing, and that
illusion is eminently necessary to <span class="locked">success.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span></p>

<p class="in0">Often he overdoes this dramatic element and becomes melodramatic;
we lose the impression of real life and feel an atmosphere
of staginess, that exaggeration of effect which thrills for
a moment and then disgusts.</p>

<p>And right here comes the chief indictment against him: he
works without deep emotion, without tenderness, without altruism,
without the higher reaches of imagination. He has no
social or moral purpose, as Howells had. He sees the body
but not the soul, society rather than life in its deeper currents,
a society marvelously complex in its requirements and
its accouterments, its conventions and traditions, but he looks
little below the superficial, the temporal, the merely worldly.
He is inferior to Howells inasmuch as he lacks poetry, he lacks
humor, he lacks heart. He is inferior to James and George
Meredith inasmuch as he had no power of introspection and no
distinctive style. He had no passion&mdash;he never becomes enthusiastic
even about his native Italy; he had little love for nature&mdash;the
city engrosses him, not trees and mountains and lakes.
He writes of the human spectacle and is content if he bring
amusement for the present moment.</p>

<p>He was, therefore, one more influence in the journalization
of the novel. He wrote rapidly and easily, and his style is
clear and natural, but it is also without distinction. His pictures
are vividly drawn and his stories are exceedingly readable&mdash;journalistic
excellences, but there is nothing of inspiration
about them, no breath of genius, no touch of literature in the
stricter sense of that word. Like every skilful journalistic
writer, he has the power to visualize his scene, to paint characters
with vividness, and to make essentials stand out. Notably
was this true of his historical fiction. Characters like Philip
II. and Eleanor, Queen of France, he can make real men and
women that move and convince. He has created a marvelous
gallery of characters, taking his forty-five novels together, complex
and varied beyond that produced by any other American
novelist, and there are surprisingly few repetitions. He stands
undoubtedly as the most brilliant of the American writers of
fiction, the most cosmopolitan, the most entertaining. His
galaxy of Roman novels, especially the <i>Saracinesca</i> group, bids
fair to outlive many novels that contain deeper studies of human
life and that are more inspired products of literary art.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The direct opposite of F. Marion Crawford, in literary belief,
as in background and object, was Margaretta Wade Deland, who
came into literary prominence at the close of the eighties. Unlike
Crawford, she was a poet, a realist, a depicter of life within
a narrow provincial area, and, moreover, a worker in the finer
materials of life, the problems of the soul.</p>

<p>The essentials of her biography are few. She was born and
reared at Manchester, a little Pennsylvania village, now swallowed
up by the great manufacturing city of Allegheny; she
went at sixteen to New York to study drawing and design at
Cooper Institute; and after her graduation she became instructor
in design at the Girls' Normal College, New York City.
In 1880 she was married to Lorin F. Deland and removed to
Boston, where she has since resided. In 1886 she issued her first
book&mdash;a collection of poems entitled <i>An Old Garden</i>, and two
years later <i>John Ward, Preacher</i>, a novel that attracted instant
and widespread attention because of its likeness in theme to
<i>Robert Elsmere</i>, then at the height of its enormous vogue.
Since that time she has published four other major novels:
<i>Sidney</i>, <i>Philip and His Wife</i>, <i>The Awakening of Helena Richie</i>,
and <i>The Iron Woman</i>, and many short stories, notably the collections
entitled <i>The Wisdom of Fools</i>, <i>Old Chester Tales</i>, and
<i>Dr. Lavendar's People</i>.</p>

<p>By nature and early environment Mrs. Deland was serious
and contemplative. The little Pennsylvania town, later to be
immortalized as Old Chester, during her childhood was a place
of traditions, a bit of antiquity amid the newness about it, of
well-bred old English and Scotch and Irish families with deep
religious prejudices and with narrow yet wholesome and kindly
ideals. She was reared in a religious atmosphere&mdash;her father
was a Presbyterian and her mother an Episcopalian, the combination
so disastrous in <i>John Ward, Preacher</i>. She lived amid
books, all of which she might read save only the novels, a prohibition
that proved to be a good one, for when at last she was
led to write fiction of her own, she went about it with no conventional
preconceptions. It made for freshness, for originality,
of concentration upon life rather than upon form and the tradition
of the elders. It was an environment that cultivated the
poet as well as the Puritan within her, the sensitiveness for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
Nature, the deeps of love and life that were to find expression
in a note like this, recorded in her first volume:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O distant Christ, the crowded, darkening years<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Drift slow between thy gracious face and me:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My hungry heart leans back to look for thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But finds the way set thick with doubts and fears.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My groping hands would touch thy garment's hem,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Would find some token thou art walking near;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Instead, they clasp but empty darkness drear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no diviner hands reach out to them.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My straining eyes, O Christ, but long to mark<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A shadow of thy presence, dim and sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or far-off light to guide my wandering feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or hope for hands prayer-beating 'gainst the dark.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>It was, therefore, but natural that her work should be both
serious and ethical and that it should be touched with beauty.
In <i>John Ward, Preacher</i>, she took as her theme the revolt of a
soul against the infallibilities of a system of belief. It is not
necessarily a religious novel or yet a purpose novel. The primary
<i>motif</i> of <i>Robert Elsmere</i> is theological and doctrinal discussion.
It is religious polemic made attractive by being cast
into story form and as such it deserves the anathema of Crawford,
but in Mrs. Deland's novel the human interest is paramount.
Religion is the force that acts upon two lives, just as
jealousy might have been taken or misdirected love or any other
human dynamic, and the novel is the record of the reactions
under the stress.</p>

<p>So with all her novels. The theme is the destruction or the
redemption of a soul, the abasement or the rehabilitation of a
character through some immaterial force applied from within.
She deals with great ethical and sociological forces: heredity,
as in her novelette <i>The Hands of Esau</i>; divorce, as in <i>The Iron
Woman</i>; the compelling power of love, as in <i>Sidney</i>. Her
primary aim is not, as with Crawford and Harte, simply to
entertain; it is rather to expose the human soul to its own view,
to show it its limitations and its dangers, that the soul may be
purged through fear of what may be&mdash;the aim indeed of the
Greek drama. Her equipment for the work was complete. To
feminine tenderness and insight she added a depth of view and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
an analysis that is masculine. She was a poet too, but a poet
with the severity of form and the moving realism of the short
story writer. Two of her novels, <i>The Awakening of Helena
Richie</i> and <i>The Iron Woman</i>, have not been surpassed in construction
and in moving power by any other writer of the
period.</p>

<p>Her <i>Old Chester Tales</i> also, with their central figure Dr.
Lavendar, have the elements that make for permanence. They
are really without time or place. Old Chester undoubtedly is
in western Pennsylvania, the author's native town, but it might
be New England as well. The tales deal with universal types
and with universal <i>motifs</i> with a broadness and a sympathy and
a literary art that raises them into the realm of the rarer classics.
From them emerges the figure of Dr. Lavendar to place beside
even Adams and Primrose. Place is not dwelt upon; humanity
is all. They are not so much stories as fragments of actual
life touched with the magic of poetry and of ethic vision. From
that worldly social area of life presented to us by such latter-day
novelists as Crawford and Edith Wharton and Robert
Chambers they are as far removed as is a fashionable Newport
yacht, with its club-centered men and cigarette-smoking women,
from the simple little hamlet among the hills.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>During the closing years of the century there came into
American literature, suddenly and unheralded, a group of young
men, journalists for the most part, who for a time seemed to
promise revolution. They brought in with a rush enthusiasm,
vigor, vitality; they had no reverence for old forms or old
ideals; they wrote with fierceness and cocksureness books like
Garland's <i>Crumbling Idols</i> and Norris's <i>The Responsibilities of
the Novelist</i>, which called shrilly for Truth, <span class="smcap">Truth</span>: "Is it
not, in Heaven's name, essential that the people hear not a lie,
but the Truth? If the novel were not one of the most important
factors of life; if it were not the completest expression
of our civilization; if its influence were not greater than all
the pulpits, than all the newspapers between the oceans, it would
not be so important that its message should be true." They
would produce a new American literature, one stripped of
prudishness and convention; they would go down among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
People and tell them the plain God's Truth as Zola defined
Truth, for the People were hungry for it. "In the larger view,
in the last analysis, the People pronounce the final judgment.
The People, despised of the artist, hooted, caricatured, and vilified,
are, after all, and in the main, the real seekers after Truth."
The group was a passing phenomenon. Many of its members
were dead before they had done more than outline their work:
Wolcott Balestier and Stephen Crane at thirty, Frank Norris at
thirty-two, Henry Harland and Harold Frederic in the early
forties, and the others, like R.&nbsp;H. Davis, for instance, turned at
length to historical romance and other conventional fields.</p>

<p>The impetus undoubtedly came from the enormous and sudden
vogue of Kipling. Balestier was his brother-in-law and
had collaborated with him in writing <i>The Naulahka</i>. Then he
had written the novel <i>Benefits Forgot</i>, a work of remarkable
promise, but remarkable only for its promise. The vigor and
directness and picturing power of the young Kipling were qualities
that appealed strongly to young men of journalistic training.
Like him, they were cosmopolitans and had seen unusual
areas of life. Crane had represented his paper in the Greco-Turkish
War and in the Cuban campaign, Norris had been in
the South African War, Richard Harding Davis had been at all
the storm centers of his time, Frederic was the European correspondent
of the New York <i>Times</i>, and Harland became at
length editor of the London <i>Yellow Book</i>.</p>

<p>The genius of the group undoubtedly was Stephen Crane
(1871&ndash;1900). He was frail of physique, neurotic, intense, full
of a vibrant energy that drove him too fiercely. He was naturally
lyrical, romantic, impulsively creative, but his training
made him, as it made most of the group, a realist&mdash;a depressed
realist after Zola. His earliest work was his best, <i>Maggie, a
Girl of the Streets</i>, a grim and brutal picture of the darker
strata of New York City&mdash;his most distinctive creation. But
he had no patience, no time, for collecting material. He was
too eager, too much under the dominance of moods, to investigate,
and his later novel, <i>The Red Badge of Courage</i>, which purports
to be a realistic story of army life in the Civil War, is
based upon a kind of manufactured realism that is the product
not of observation or of gathered data, but of an excessively
active imagination. When he died, though he was but thirty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
he had done his work. Despite his lyrical power and his undoubted
imagination, his place is not large.</p>

<p>For Frank Norris (1870&ndash;1902) more may be said, though undoubtedly
he has been judged by his contemporaries more by
what he dreamed of doing and what, perhaps, he might have
done had he lived than by his actual accomplishment. He had
had unusual training for the epic task he set himself. He had
been born in Chicago and had spent there the first fifteen years
of his life, he had been educated in the San Francisco high
school, at the University of California, and at Harvard, then
for a year or two he had studied art in Paris. Later he was war
correspondent of the San Francisco <i>Chronicle</i>, then editor of
the San Francisco <i>Wave</i>, then special war correspondent for
<i>McClure's Magazine</i> during the Spanish War.</p>

<p>When he began to write fiction, and he began early, he was an
ardent disciple of Zola, a realist of the latter-day type, a teller
of the Truth as Zola conceived of the Truth. "Mere literature"
was a thing outworn, graces of style and gentleness of theme
belonged to the effeminate past. A masculine age had come
to which nothing was common or unclean provided it were but
the Truth. Like Crane, he was eager, excited, dominated by
his theme until it became his whole life. He could work only
in major key, in <i>fortissimo</i>, with themes continent-wide presented
with the Kipling vigor and swing.</p>

<p>In his earlier work, <i>Vandover and the Brute</i>, <i>McTeague</i>, and
the like, he swung to the extreme of his theory. To tell the
truth was to tell with microscopic detail the repulsive things of
physical life. There are stories of his that reek with foul odors
and jangle repulsively upon the eye and the ear. The short
fiction "A Man's Woman" is an advance even upon Zola. It
is Truth, but it is the truth about the processes of the sewer
and the physiological facts about starvation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The tent was full of foul smells: the smell of drugs and of moldy
gunpowder, the smell of dirty rags, of unwashed bodies, the smell of
stale smoke, of scorching sealskin, of soaked and rotting canvas that
exhaled from the tent cover&mdash;every smell but that of food.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0"><i>McTeague</i> is a brutal book: it gets hold of one's imagination
and haunts it like an odor from a morgue. So with certain
scenes from <i>Vandover and the Brute</i>. One sees for weeks the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
ghastly face of that drowning Jew who, after the wreck of the
steamer, was beaten off again and again until his mashed fingers
could no longer gain a hold. True to life it undoubtedly is, but
to what end?</p>

<p>Norris's master work was to be his trilogy, the epic of the
wheat, the allegory of financial and industrial America. He explained
his purpose in the preface to <i>The Pit</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>These novels, while forming a series, will be in no way connected
with each other save by their relation to (1) the production, (2) the
distribution, (3) the consumption of American wheat. When complete
they will form the story of a crop of wheat from the time of
its sowing as seed in California to the time of its consumption as
bread in a village of Western Europe.</p>

<p>The first novel, <i>The Octopus</i>, deals with the war between the wheat
grower and the Railroad Trust; the second, <i>The Pit</i>, is the fictitious
narrative of a "deal" in the Chicago wheat pit; while the third, <i>The
Wolf</i>, will probably have for its pivotal episode the relieving of a
famine in an old world community.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">He lived to complete only the first two, and it is upon these
two that his place as a novelist must depend. They represent
his maturer work, his final manner, and they undoubtedly show
what would have been his product had he been spared to complete
his work.</p>

<p>The two books impress one first with their vastness of theme.
The whole continent seems to be in them. They have an untamed
power, an elemental quality, an unconfined sweep that is
Russian in its quality. They are epics, epics of a new continent
with its untold richness in corn and wheat, its enmeshing railroads,
its teeming cities of the plain, its restless human types&mdash;new
birth of our new soil. The excitement and the enthusiasm
of the novelist flow from every page. To read long is to be
filled with the trembling eagerness of the wheat pit and the
railroad yard. The style is headlong, excited, illuminated hotly
with Hugo-like adjectives. Through it all runs a symbolism
that at times takes full control. The railroad dominates <i>The
Octopus</i>, the wheat <i>The Pit</i> as fully as the hemp dominates
Allen's <i>Reign of Law</i>. The books are allegories. The Western
farmer is in the grip of an octopus-like monster, the railroad,
that is strangling him. The ghastly horror of the locomotive
that plows at full speed through a flock of sheep is symbolic of
his helplessness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>To the right and left, all the width of the right of way, the little
bodies had been flung; backs were snapped against the fence-posts;
brains knocked out. Caught in the barbs of the wire, wedged in, the
bodies hung suspended. Under foot it was terrible; the black blood,
winking in the starlight, seeped down into the clay between the ties with
a long sucking murmur.... Abruptly, Presley saw again in his imagination
the galloping monster, the terror of steel and steam, with its
single eye, cyclopean, red, shooting from horizon to horizon; but saw
it now as the symbol of a vast power, huge, terrible, flinging the echo
of its thunder over all the reaches of the valley, leaving blood and
destruction in its path; the leviathan, with tentacles of steel clutching
into the soil, the soulless Force, the iron-hearted Power, the Monster,
the Colossus, the Octopus.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Garland in such pictures as "Under the Lion's Paw" tends
to arouse his reader to mutiny, to the cry "This thing must
stop!" Norris fills him with shuddering horror and leaves him
unnerved.</p>

<p>Tremendous energy the novels undoubtedly have and truth
too, so far as it goes. They have imaginative power of no inferior
type and an ardor that is contagious. It was worth
while to have written them: they picture for all time a unique
phase of American life, but it is no great loss to our literature
that the two were not expanded into a long series. In the
higher sense of the word they are not literature; they are remarkably
well done newspaper "stories." Like most of the
work of his group of writers, they are journalistic in pitch and
in intent: stirring narratives, picturesque presentings of unusual
material, timely studies in dynamic style. But literary
art is founded upon restraint, reserve, poise. These stories
lack finish, concentration, and even, at times, good taste.
Everywhere full organ, everywhere tenseness, everywhere excitement.
A terrible directness there is, but it tends no whither
and it comes to no terminus of conclusion.</p>

<p>Norris unquestionably lacked knowledge of many of the most
fundamental areas of human life. He was too insistently modern.
Like the mere journalist, he was obsessed with but a single
thought: the value of the present moment. He lacked a sense
of the past, personal background, inner life, power to weigh
and balance and compare, and, lacking these, he lacked the elements
that make for the literature of permanence.</p>

<p>Henry Harland's (1861&ndash;1905) earliest work, <i>As It Was Written</i>
(1885), <i>Mrs. Peixada</i>, and <i>The Yoke of the Thora</i> (1887),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
written under the pen name "Sidney Luska," presented certain
phases of Jewish life and character in New York with a
grim power that seemed promising, but his later work was
decadent. Harold Frederic was a more substantial figure. A
typical American, self-made and self-educated, climbing by
rapid stages from the positions of farm hand, photographer, and
proof-reader to the editorship of influential papers like the Albany
<i>Journal</i>, at twenty-eight he was the European representative
of the New York <i>Times</i> and an international correspondent
of rare power. Novel-writing he took up as a recreation. His
earliest work, which appeared in <i>Scribner's Magazine</i>, <i>Seth's
Brother's Wife</i> (1887), was a novel of New York farm life,
Garland-like in its depressing realism. Later stories like <i>In the
Valley</i> and <i>The Copperhead</i> dealt with a background of the
Civil War. His greatest success came with <i>The Damnation of
Theron Ware</i>, published in England with the title <i>Illumination</i>,
a remarkable book especially in its earlier chapters, full of vigor
and truth. Undoubtedly he possessed the rare gift of story-telling,
and had he, like Crawford, devoted himself wholly to
the art, he might have done work to compare with any other
written during the period. But he was a journalist with newspaper
standards, he worked in haste, he lacked repose and the
sense of values, and as a result a republication of his novels
has not been called for. He is to be ranked with Crane and
Norris as a meteor of brilliance rather than a fixed light.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The new realism was short lived. Even while its propaganda
like <i>Crumbling Idols</i> and <i>The Responsibilities of the
Novelist</i> were spreading the news that Walter Scott was dead
and that the god of things as they are had come in his power,
a new romantic period already had begun. Maurice Thompson,
one of the most clear-eyed critics of the period, wrote in
May, 1900:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Just how deep and powerful the present distinct movement toward
a romantic revival may be no one can tell. Many facts, however, point
to a veering of popular interest from the fiction of character analysis
and social problems to the historical novel and the romance of heroic
adventure. We have had a period of intense, not to say morbid, introversion
directed mainly upon diseases of the social, domestic, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>political,
and religious life of the world. It may be that, like all other
currents of interest when turned upon insoluble problems, this rush
of inquiry, this strain of exploitation, has about run its course....
Great commercial interest seems to be turned or turning from the
world of commonplace life and the story of the analysis of crime and
filth to the historical romance, the story of heroism, and the tale of
adventure. People seem to be interested as never before in the interpretation
of history. It may be that signs in the air of great world
changes have set all minds more or less to feeling out for precedents
and examples by which to measure the future's <span class="locked">probabilities.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>The causes of this later wave of romanticism, a wave that was
wider than America, have been variously estimated. Harold
Frederic suggested Blackmore as the possible fountain head.
"Was it <i>Lorna Doone</i>, I wonder, that changed the drift in historical
fiction? The book, after it was once introduced to public
attention by that comic accident which no one can blame Mr.
Blackmore for grinding his teeth over, achieved, as it deserved,
one of the great successes of our time&mdash;and great successes set
men <span class="locked">thinking."<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></span> Paul Leicester Ford, himself an historian
and a notable producer of historical romance, was inclined to
another explanation: "At the present moment [1897] there
seems a revival of interest in American history, and the novelist
has been quickly responsive to <span class="locked">it."<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></span> The English critic E.&nbsp;A.
Bennett offered still another solution: "America is a land of
crazes. In other words, it is simple: no derision is implied....
And America is also a land of sentimentalism. It
is this deep-seated quality which, perhaps, accounts for the
vogue of history in American fiction. The themes of the historical
novel are so remote, ideas about them exist so nebulously
in the mind, that a writer may safely use the most bare-faced
distortions to pamper the fancy without offending that natural
and racial shrewdness which would bestir itself if a means of
verification were at hand. The extraordinary notion still obtains
that human nature was different 'in those days'; that the
good old times were, somehow, 'pretty,' and governed by fates
poetically <span class="locked">just."<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>Ford undoubtedly was right in assigning the immediate outburst
at the close of the century to a new interest in American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
history. The war with Spain brought about a burst of
patriotism and of martial feeling that made the swashbuckling
romance and the episode from the American Revolution seem
peculiarly appropriate. But the war was by no means the only
cause. The reaction had come earlier, a reaction from the excess
of reality that had come with the eighties. The influence
of Stevenson must not be overlooked, Stevenson who, type of
his age, had sickened early of the realistic, the analytic, the
problematic.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I do desire a book of adventure," Stevenson had written to Henley
as early as 1884, "a romance&mdash;and no man will get or write me one.
Dumas I have read and re-read too often; Scott, too, and I am short.
I want to hear swords clash. I want a book to begin in a good way;
a book, I guess, like <i>Treasure Island</i>.... Oh, my sighings after romance,
or even Skeltery, and O! the weary age which will produce me
neither!</p>

<p class="p1 in0 center">"'<span class="smcap">Chapter I</span></p>

<p>"'The night was damp and cloudy, the ways foul. The single horseman,
cloaked and booted, who pursued his way across Willesden Common,
had not met a traveler, when the sound of wheels....'</p>

<p class="p1 in0 center">"'<span class="smcap">Chapter II</span></p>

<p>"'"Yes, sir," said the old pilot, "she must have dropped into the bay
a little afore dawn. A queer craft she looks."</p>

<p>"'"She shows no colors," returned the young gentleman, musingly.</p>

<p>"'"They're a-lowering of a quarter-boat, Mr. Mark," resumed the
old salt. "We shall soon know more of her."</p>

<p>"'"Aye," replied the young gentleman called Mark, "and here, Mr.
Seadrift, comes your sweet daughter Nancy tripping down the cliff."</p>

<p>"'"God bless her kind heart, sir," ejaculated old Seadrift.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Be the cause what it may, for a time historical romance was
the dominant literary form in America. In 1902, Bliss Perry,
editor of the <i>Atlantic</i>, could write of "the present passion for
historical novels." To what extent they were a passion may
be learned from the records of publishers. By the summer of
1901, Ford's <i>Janice Meredith</i> had sold 275,000 copies, Mary
Johnston's <i>To Have and to Hold</i>, 285,000, and Churchill's <i>The
Crisis</i>, 320,000, and his <i>Richard Carvel</i>, 420,000.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> One might
give equally large figures for such favorites as Charles Major's
<i>When Knighthood Was in Flower</i>, Tarkington's <i>Monsieur
Beaucaire</i>, Mitchell's <i>Hugh Wynne, Free Quaker</i>, Thompson's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
<i>Alice of Old Vincennes</i>, and very many others, foreign as well
as American.</p>

<p>The novels fall into two classes: those in which the historical
element is made emphatic and those which are pure romances.
Of the former class Paul Leicester Ford's <i>Janice Meredith</i> is,
perhaps, the best type; of the latter, Mitchell's <i>Hugh Wynne</i>.
Ford was first of all a historian, a bibliographer, a tireless delver
among historical sources. He had been educated in his father's
library, which contained the finest collection of Americana in
the world, and at twelve we find him publishing on his own
press a genealogy of Webster of his own compilation. His later
bibliographical and historical work centered about the American
Revolution. When he turned to fiction it was as a historian,
a specialist who would exploit real historical characters
and real areas of American life. <i>The Honorable Peter Stirling</i>
was a study of ward politics with the young Grover Cleveland
as the central figure. It was an accurate picture, vigorous and
truthful, and even though a fiction it is a valuable historical
document. So it was with <i>Janice Meredith</i>, a historian's day-dream
over his Americana. It presents an accurate picture of
the social conditions of its time. Many of its characters are
revolutionary leaders: Washington is a central figure&mdash;"The
true George Washington," presented with all his failings as
well as with all his excellences.</p>

<p>It was natural that Ford should make much of the material
that he knew so thoroughly: he brought it in sometimes for its
own sake rather than for the sake of the story. Undoubtedly
he falsified history by making his real personages, like Washington
and Franklin, take part in conversations that never occurred
and do things that strictly never were done, but it is
equally true that he has given us the best conception that is
now possible of how it must have felt to live in the days of the
Revolution. His chief excellences were his vigor and vivacity,
and his Norris-like mastery of details. He was a realist enamoured
of truth who extended his realism into the domain of
romance. His faults all centered about his undoubted deficiency
in literary art: he lacked constructive power and distinction
of style. His stories are the diversions of a professional
historian, brilliant but without promise of permanence.</p>

<p>Typical of the second variety of historical romance is the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
of Silas Weir Mitchell, poet, romancer, artist, and historian.
Dr. Mitchell was of Philadelphia as Dr. Holmes was of Boston,
and like Dr. Holmes he gave his most vigorous years completely
to his profession. He was fifty-three and one of the leading
world specialists on nervous diseases when he wrote his first
full novel, <i>In War Time</i>. His own explanation, given in later
years to a gathering of University of Pennsylvania men, has
often been quoted:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When success in my profession gave me the freedom of long summer
holidays, the despotism of my habits of work would have made entire
idleness mere <i>ennui</i>. I turned to what, except for stern need, would
have been my lifelong work from youth&mdash;literature&mdash;bored by idleness,
wrote my first novel.</p></blockquote>

<p>The confession in the latter sentence is significant. Poetry
all his life was to him an exalted thing, as it was, indeed, to
Stoddard and the other poets of beauty. In later years he published
many volumes of it and contributed it to the magazines,
but never for money. It explains much in his work. No other
novelist of the period has so filled his fiction with quoted lyrics
and with lyrical prose. It is here that he differs from writers
like Ford and Norris: he would produce literature.</p>

<p>His list of work is a varied one. His first long novel and
also his last dealt with the Civil War, in which he had served
three years as a surgeon. Then, like Dr. Holmes, he wrote
pathological studies on which he brought to bear his vast medical
knowledge, novels like <i>Dr. North and His Friends</i> and <i>Constance
Trescott</i>; he wrote brilliant tales of French life, like <i>The
Adventures of François</i>, Dr. Mitchell's favorite among his
novels, and <i>A Diplomatic Adventure</i>; he wrote idyllic studies
of Nature like <i>When All the Woods Are Green</i>, and <i>Far in the
Forest</i>, and, best of all, the historical romances <i>Hugh Wynne,
Free Quaker</i>, and <i>The Red City</i>.</p>

<p>These novels more than any others written during the period
are products of an exact and extensive knowledge of the materials
of which they are woven. We feel at every point that
we are in the hands of an expert, the ablest neurologist of his
generation, who has seen intimately vast areas of life of which
the average reader knows nothing. His analysis of a character
has the exactness of a clinic and he adds to it, moreover, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
imaginative power that makes us see as well as know and feel.
He is skilful in characterization. "Character," he once wrote,
"is best delineated by occasional broad touches, without much
explanatory comment, without excess of minute description. If
I fail to characterize, I fail in novel writing." He has not
failed. Octavia Blake in the novel <i>Roland Blake</i> is drawn with
peculiar skill; so is Lucretia Hunter in <i>Circumstance</i>, so is Constance
Trescott, that study of over-devotion. Always is he best
in his studies of femininity, doubtless because women had played
so large a part in his medical practice.</p>

<p>With few exceptions his characters are from the higher
classes, "gentlefolk," he has called them in his novel <i>Dr. North</i>,
and he has made them alive, as Howells was unable to do, and
even James. He has discussed the point himself: "Nor can I
tell why some men can not create gentlefolk. It is not knowledge,
nor is it the being in or of their world that gives this
power. Thackeray had it; so had Trollope; Dickens never; nor,
in my mind, was George Eliot always happy in this respect;
and of the living I shall say <span class="locked">nothing."<a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></span> We feel this quality
most strongly in his historical novels. He knew intimately his
background, Old Philadelphia with its exclusive aristocracy,
and he has been able to transport his reader into the very atmosphere
of old Second Street, in the days when it contained the
most distinctive social set in America. He was a part of it;
he wrote as if he were writing his own family history, lovingly,
reverently. He was writing romance, but he was writing it as
one who is on sacred historical ground where error of fact or of
inference is unpardonable. He has himself outlined the work
of the historical romancer:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Suppose I have a story to tell and wish to evolve character amid
the scenery and events of an historical episode. Suppose, for instance,
the story to lie largely in a great city. For years I must study
the topography, dress, manners, and family histories; must be able in
mind to visit this or that house; know where to call, whom I shall see,
the hours of meals, the diet, games, etc. I must know what people
say on meeting and parting. Then I must read letters, diaries, and so
on, to get the speech forms and to enable me, if it be autobiography,
to command the written style of the day. Most men who write thus
of another time try to give the effect of actuality by an excessive use
of archaic forms. Only enough should be used to keep from time
to time some touch of this past, and not so much as to distract <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>incessantly
by needless reminders. It is an art, and, like all good art effects,
it escapes complete analysis.</p>

<p>Then as to the use of historical characters. These must naturally
influence the fate of your puppets; they must never be themselves the
most prominent personages of your <span class="locked">story.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>He presents his material with skill: he is a story-teller; his
plots move strongly and always by means not of explanations
but of the self-development of his characters. Even his most
minor figures form a distinct part of the movement. His style
has more of distinction than has any other of the later romancers.
He brought to his work the older ideals of literary
form and expression, and he wrought not with the haste of the
journalist and special correspondent, but with the leisure of
the deliberate man of letters. Without question he is as large
a figure in his period as Dr. Holmes was in his, and there are
those who would rank him as the greater of the two. That he
has not been given a more commanding place is due undoubtedly
to his great fame as a medical expert. The physician has overshadowed
the author.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>The enormous quantity and richness of the fiction of the
period make impossible extended criticism of any save those
who were leaders or innovators. Many did most excellent work,
work indeed in some cases that seems to point to permanence,
yet since they brought nothing new either in material or in
method we need not dwell long upon them.</p>

<p>No type of fiction, for instance, was more abundant all
through the period than that which we have called the E.&nbsp;P.
Roe type, and the most voluminous producer of it undoubtedly
was Captain, later General, Charles King, who created no fewer
than fifty-five novels of the half-sensational, half-sentimental
type which we associate with the name of Roe. With his wide
knowledge of army life, especially as lived in the frontier camps
of the West after the Civil War, he was able to give his work
a verisimilitude that added greatly to their popularity. The
love story was skilfully blended with what seemed to be real
history. The frontier stories of Mary Hallock Foote, wife of
a civil engineer whose work called him into the mining camps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
of Colorado and Idaho, have the same characteristics. Their
author, a clever illustrator, was able to extend her art to her
descriptions of the primitive regions and savage humanity of
the frontier, and for a time she was compared even with Bret
Harte. But not for long. Her books, save for their novelty
of setting, have no characteristics that are not conventional.
Better is the work of Clara Louise Burnham. There is in her
fiction more of imaginative power and more command of the
subtleties of style, but even her best efforts fall far short of
distinction.</p>

<p>Of the romancers of the period the leader for a time unquestionably
was Julian Hawthorne, only son of the greatest of
American romancers. In his earlier days he devoted himself
to themes worthy of the Hawthorne name and treated them in
what fairly may be called the Hawthorne manner. His novels,
like <i>Bressant</i> and <i>Archibald Malmaison</i>, were hailed everywhere
as remarkably promising work and there were many who predicted
for him a place second only to his father's. But the man
lacked seriousness, conscience, depth of life, knowledge of the
human heart. After a short period of worthy endeavor he
turned to the sensational and the trivial, and became a yellow
journalist. No literary career seemingly so promising has ever
failed more dismally.</p>

<p>Stronger romancers by far have been Blanche Willis Howard,
Frederick J. Stimson, and Arthur Sherburne Hardy. Few
American women have been more brilliant than Miss Howard.
Her <i>One Summer</i> has a sprightliness and a humor about it that
are perennial, and her Breton romance <i>Guenn</i> is among the
greatest romances of the period in either England or America.
The spirit of true romance breathes from it; and it came alive
from its creator's heart and life. So far does it surpass all her
other work that she is rated more and more now as a single-work
artist. She passed her last years away from America in
Stuttgart, where her husband, Herr von Teuffel, was acting as
court physician to the king of Würtemberg. Hardy also was a
romancer, a stylist of the French type, brilliant, finished. Few
have ever brought to fiction a mind more keenly alert and more
analytical. He was a mathematician of note, a writer of
treatises on least squares and quarternions. But he was a poet
as well and a romancer. His <i>But yet a Woman</i> has an atmosphere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
about it that is rarely found in literature in English.
His <i>Passe Rose</i> is the most idealistic of all the historical romances:
it moves like a prose poem. Stimson too had artistic
imagination, grace of style of the old type joined to the freshness
and vigor of the new period. It is to be regretted that he
chose to devote himself to the law and write legal treatises that
are everywhere recognized as authoritative rather than to do
highly distinctive work in the more creative field of prose
romance. None of these writers may be said to have added
anything really new to the province in which they worked and
so may be dismissed with a brief comment. They worked in old
material with old methods and largely with old ideals, and
though they worked often with surpassing skill, they were followers
rather than leaders.</p>

<p>Several novels made much stir in the day of their first appearance,
Bellamy's <i>Looking Backward</i>, for instance, John
Hay's <i>The Bread-Winners</i> (1884), and Fuller's <i>The Cliff
Dwellers</i>, that picture of Chicago life that for a time was thought
to be as promising as Frank Norris's realistic work. Robert
Grant's humorous and sprightly studies of society and life were
also at various times much discussed, but all of them are seen
now to have been written for their own generation alone. With
every decade almost there comes a newness that for a time is
supposed to put into eclipse even the fixed stars. A quarter of
a century, however, tells the story. The Norwegian scholar and
poet and novelist Boyesen, who did what Howells really did
not do, take Tolstoy as his master, was thought for two decades
to be of highest rank, but to-day his work, save for certain sections
of his critical studies, is no longer read.</p>

<p>Even F. Hopkinson Smith is too near just at present for us
to prophesy with confidence, yet it is hard to believe that his
Colonel Carter is to be forgotten, and there are other parts
of his work, like <i>Tom Grogan</i> and <i>Caleb West</i>, books that centered
about his profession of lighthouse architect, that seem
now like permanent additions to American fiction. There was a
breeziness about his style, a cosmopolitanism, a sense of knowledge
and authority that is most convincing. Some of his short
stories, like those for instance in <i>At Close Range</i>&mdash;"A Night
Out," to be still more specific&mdash;have a picturing power, a perfect
naturalness, an accuracy of diction, that mark them as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
triumphs of realism in its best sense. Like Dr. Mitchell, he came
late to literature, but when he did come he came strongly, laden
with a wealth of materials, and he has left behind him a handful
at least of novels and studies that bid fair to endure long.</p>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Of the younger group of novelists, those writers born in the
sixties and early seventies and publishing their first novels during
the first decade of the new century, we shall say little. The
new spirit of nationality that came in the seventies did not furnish
the impulse that produced the work of this second generation
of the period. It is a school of novelists distinct and by
itself. We may only call the roll of its leaders, arranging it,
perhaps, in the order of seniority: Gertrude Franklin Atherton
(1859&mdash;&mdash;), Bliss Perry (1860&mdash;&mdash;), Owen Wister
(1860&mdash;&mdash;), John Fox, Jr. (1863&mdash;&mdash;), Holman F. Day
(1865&mdash;&mdash;), Robert W. Chambers (1865&mdash;&mdash;), Meredith
Nicholson (1866&mdash;&mdash;), David Graham Philips (1867&ndash;1911),
Robert Herrick (1868&mdash;&mdash;), Newton Booth Tarkington
(1869&mdash;&mdash;), Mary Johnston (1870&mdash;&mdash;), Edith Wharton (&mdash;&mdash;),
Alice Hegan Rice (1870&mdash;&mdash;), Winston Churchill (1871&mdash;&mdash;),
Stewart Edward White (1873&mdash;&mdash;), Ellen Anderson Glasgow
(1874&mdash;&mdash;), Jack London (1876&ndash;1916). The earlier work of
some of these writers falls under classifications which we have
already discussed, as for instance Churchill's <i>Richard Carvel</i>,
Mary Johnston's <i>Prisoners of Hope</i>, Chambers's <i>Cardigan</i>, and
Wister's <i>The Virginian</i>. Of the great mass of the fiction of the
group, however, and of a still younger group we shall say nothing.
It was not inspired by the impulse that in the sixties and
the seventies produced the National Period.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE ESSAYISTS</span></h2>

<p>In forms other than fiction and poetry the period was also
voluminous. The greater part of our historical writings has
been produced since 1870 and the same is true of our biography.
Literary quality, however, has suffered. Emphasis has been
placed upon material rather than upon graces of style; upon
matter, but little upon manner. Never before have historian
and biographer been so tireless in their search for sources:
the <i>Battles and Leaders of the Civil War</i> is a veritable library
of materials; the Life of Lincoln by Nicolay and Hay contains
one million five hundred thousand words. It is as long as Bancroft's
whole history of the United States, it is twice as long as
Green's <i>History of the English People</i>, and it contains three
hundred thousand words more than Gibbon's <i>Decline and Fall
of the Roman Empire</i>. It has been a development from the
spirit of the era: the demand for actuality. Never before such
eagerness to uncover new facts, to present documents, to be
realistically true, but it has been at the expense of literary style.
A few books, like General Grant's <i>Memoirs</i> and Captain Mahan's
<i>The Influence of Sea Power upon History</i>, have had the power
of simplicity, the impelling force that comes from consciousness
only of the message to be delivered. But all too often the
material has been presented in a colorless, journalistic form
that bars it forever from consideration as literature in the
higher sense of that term. The most of it, even the life of
Lincoln, is to be placed in the same category as scientific writings
and all those other prose forms that are concerned only
with the presenting of positive knowledge. Parkman seems to
have been the last historian who was able to present his material
with literary distinction.</p>

<p>The essay has been voluminous all through the period, but
it too has changed its tone. More than any other literary form
it has been the medium through which we may trace the transition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
from the old period to the new. American literature had
begun with the essay, and we have seen how the form, designated
by the name of sketch, grew in the hands of Irving and
Hawthorne and Poe into what in the period of the seventies
became recognized as a distinct literary form with the name
of short story.</p>

<p>The literary essay is a classical form: to flourish, it needs the
atmosphere of old culture and established social traditions; it
must work in the materials of classic literature; it is leisurely
in method, discursive, gently sentimental. It was the dominating
form, it will be remembered, in the classical age of Addison,
the age of manners and mind. It was peculiarly fitted, too,
to be the literary vehicle of the later classical age in America,
the Europe-centered period of Irving and Emerson and Willis
and Holmes. The early pilgrims to the holy land of the Old
World sent back their impressions and dreamings in the form
of essays: Longfellow's <i>Outre-Mer</i>, for example, and Willis's
<i>Pencillings by the Way</i>. On the same shelf with <i>The Sketch
Book</i> belong Willis's <i>Letters from Under a Bridge</i>, Dana's <i>The
Idle Man</i>, Donald G. Mitchell's <i>Reveries of a Bachelor</i>, Curtis's
<i>Prue and I</i>, and a great mass of similar work, enough indeed to
give color and even name to its period. This shelf more than
any other marks the extent of England's dominion over the
literature of the first three quarters of the nineteenth century:
it was the most distinctive product of our classical age. Until
America has a rich background of her own with old culture and
traditions, with venerable native classics from which to quote,
and a long vista of romantic history down which to look, her
contemplative and strictly literary essays must necessarily be
redolent of the atmosphere of other lands.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>The National Period, with its new breath of all-Americanism,
its new romantic spirit, its youthful exuberance, and its self-realization,
has been, therefore, not a period in which the essay
of the old type could find congenial soil. Instead of the Irving
sketch there has been the vivid, sharply cut short story; instead
of the contemplative, dreamy study of personalities and institutions&mdash;Irving's
"The Broken Heart," Longfellow's "Père
la Chaise"&mdash;there have been incisive, analytical, clearly cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
special studies, like Woodrow Wilson's <i>Mere Literature and
Other Essays</i>; instead of the delightful, discursive personal tattle
of a Charles Lamb and a Dr. Holmes there has been the
colorless editorial essay, all force and facts, or the undistinctive,
business-like special article, prosiest of all prose.</p>

<p>The transition figure in the history of the American essay
was Charles Dudley Warner, the last of the contemplative
<i>Sketch Book</i> essayists, and, with Higginson, Burroughs, Maurice
Thompson, and others, a leading influence in the bringing in of
the new freshness and naturalness and journalistic abandon
that gave character to the prose of the later period. He was a
New Englander, one of that small belated group born in the
twenties&mdash;Mitchell, Hale, Higginson, Norton, for example&mdash;that
found itself in a Janus-like position between the old school
of Emerson and Longfellow and the new school of non-New Englanders&mdash;Harte,
Hay, Howells, Mark Twain. Warner was peculiarly
a transition figure. He could collaborate with Mark
Twain on that most distinctively latter-day novel <i>The Gilded
Age</i>, and be classed by his generation with the humorists of
the Burdette, Josh Billings group, yet at the death of George
William Curtis he could be chosen as without question the only
logical heir to the Editor's Easy Chair department of <i>Harper's
Magazine</i>.</p>

<p>Warner was born in 1829, the birth year of Dr. S. Weir
Mitchell, and his birthplace was a farm in western Massachusetts,
where his ancestors for generations had been sturdy Puritan
yeomen. The atmosphere of this home and the round of its
life he has described with autobiographic pen in <i>Being a Boy</i>,
the most valuable of all his studies. Concerning the rest of his
life one needs only to record that he was graduated from Hamilton
College in 1851 and from the law department of the University
of Pennsylvania in 1857, and that after four years of
legal practice in Chicago he was invited by his classmate, Senator
J.&nbsp;R. Hawley, to remove to Hartford, Connecticut, to become
associate editor of the paper that was soon merged with the
Hartford <i>Courant</i>. To this paper either as its editor or as a
contributor he gave the best years of his life. He used his
vacations for foreign travel, at one time spending a year and
a half abroad, and in his later years he saw much of his own
land, but always he traveled pen in hand, ready to embody every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
observation and sentiment in a letter for the readers at home.
Travel letters of the older type they were, such as Taylor wrote
home from Germany and Curtis sent from the Nile and the
Levant, gently sentimental, humorous in a pervasive way, perfectly
natural, unconscious of style.</p>

<p>Warner was forty and a confirmed journalist before he published
anything in book form, and even this first volume was not
written with book intent. He had contributed a rambling series
of papers to the <i>Courant</i>, a sort of humorous echo of Greeley's
<i>What I Know about Farming</i>, careless, newspapery, funny in
a chuckling sort of way, and perfectly unconventional and free
from effort. Naturalness was its main charm. The period was
ready for out-of-doors themes simply presented, and it found
an enthusiastic circle of readers who demanded its publication
in book form. Henry Ward Beecher was among them and as
an inducement he promised an introductory letter. The result
was <i>My Summer in a Garden</i>, 1870, a book that sprang into
wide popularity and that undoubtedly was one of the formative
influences of the new period. He followed it with <i>Backlog
Studies</i>, a series of sketches of the Donald G. Mitchell variety,
and then with various travel books like <i>Saunterings</i> and <i>My
Winter on the Nile</i>. Late in life he published novels, <i>A Little
Journey in the World</i>, <i>The Golden House</i>, and others dealing
with phases of life in New York City, and he served as editor
of several important series of books, notably The American
Men of Letters Series of biographies, to which he himself contributed
the life of Irving.</p>

<p>Time enough has elapsed to enable us to consider the work
of Warner apart from the charm of his personal presence,
and it is seen now that his generation overestimated his work.
He was in no sense an inspired soul; he had little to offer that
was really new. He wrote like the practical editor of a daily
paper, fluently, copiously, unhesitatingly. The style is that of
the practised worker who dictates to his stenographer. There
is lack of incisiveness, sharpness of outline, cohesion of thought.
He lacks revision, flashes of insight, creative moments when
the pen is forgotten. He wrote on many topics, but there are
no passages that one is compelled to quote. He was a classicist
who wrote with perfect coolness, just as others had written before
him. His gentle spirit, his sentiment, his Puritan conscience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
and a certain serenity of view that whispered of high
character and perfect breeding, endeared him to his first readers.
But his style of humor belonged only to his own generation&mdash;it
was not embodied at all in a humorous character; and his
ethical teachings seem trite now and conventional. His influence
at a critical period of American literature entitles him
to serious consideration, but he won for himself no permanent
place. He will live longest, perhaps, in a few of his shorter
pieces: <i>Being a Boy</i>, "How Spring Came in New England,"
"A-Hunting the Deer," and "Old Mountain Phelps."</p>

<p>There are those who would rate his novels above his essays,
those indeed who would rate them even with the work of
Howells. Not many, however. That his fiction has about it a
certain power can not be denied. Its author had the journalistic
sense of the value of contemporary events, as well as the journalistic
faculty for gathering interesting facts. He had, too, what
so many novelists lack, the power to trace by almost imperceptible
processes the gradual growth of a character. <i>A Little Journey
in the World</i>, for instance, is a study of degeneration, skilfully
done. A woman who has been reared among humble yet ennobling
surroundings removes to New York and marries a very
rich man and we are shown how little by little all that is really
fine at the heart of her life is eaten away though the surface
remains as beautiful as ever. There is a naturalness about it
that is charming, and there is evident everywhere an honesty
of purpose and a depth of experience that are unusual, but one
may not say more. The novels came from the critical impulse
rather than from the creative. They are humanitarian documents
rather than creations breathing the breath of life. They
do not move us. To realize where they fail one has but to compare
his chapters in <i>The Gilded Age</i> with Mark Twain's. It
is like looking from a still-life picture on a parlor wall out upon
an actual steamboat pulling showily up to a Mississippi wharf.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The opposite of Warner in every respect was Lafcadio Hearn,
a figure more picturesque even than Joaquin Miller and more
puzzling than Whitman. Instead of serene classicism, genius;
instead of Puritan inflexibility and reverence for the respectable,
tumultuous wanderings&mdash;a man without a country, without a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
religion, without anything fixed save a restless love of the beautiful&mdash;emotional,
a bundle of nerves, moody, sudden, the gorgeous
Gallic at eternal odds with the florid, beauty-loving
Hellenic; a man forever homeless, yet forever pathetic with a
nostalgia that finally broke his heart. His personality was a
strangely elusive one, and his biography, especially in its earlier
years, is as full of romantic conjecture as De Quincey's early
life or Byron's. His very name was romantic. His father,
member of an ancient Irish family, had accompanied his regiment
as surgeon-major into the East, and while stationed at
Corfu had become infatuated with a beautiful Grecian girl,
Rosa Cerigote, and had married her. Lafcadio they named their
son from the island where he was born, his mother's home,
Leucadia, in modern Greek Lefcadia, the Ionian island of
Sappho. Here he spent his babyhood, how much of it we do
not know. Of his father, he has said nothing, and of his mother,
only this hint in a later bit of impressionism&mdash;elusive, suggestive,
characteristic:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have memory of a place and a magical time, in which the sun and
the moon were larger and brighter than now. Whether it was of this
life or of some life before, I can not tell, but I know the sky was very
much more blue, and nearer to the world&mdash;almost as it seems to become
above the masts of a steamer steaming into the equatorial summer....
Each day there were new wonders and new pleasures for
me, and all that country and time were softly ruled by one who
thought only of ways to make me happy.... When day was done
and there fell the great hush of the light before moonrise, she would
tell me stories that made me tingle from head to foot with pleasure.
I have never heard any other stories half so beautiful. And when the
pleasure became too great, she would sing a weird little song which
always brought sleep. At last there came a parting day; and she wept
and told me of a charm she had given that I must never, never lose,
because it would keep me young, and give me power to return. But I
never returned. And the years went; and one day I knew I had
lost the charm, and had become ridiculously old.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Was it the Ægean island of his birth or was it the West Indian
island to which his father later was ordered with his regiment?
We do not know. We know, however, that the mother lived for
a time in Ireland, that another son was born, and then when
the elder boy was seven she went away to Smyrna never to
return. The rest is conjecture, save for the significant fact
that both parents soon afterward married again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
The boy, unwelcome, forlorn, out of sympathy with his surroundings,
was sent to live with his aunt in Ireland, then later
was put to school in France in preparation for the priesthood.
Two years in France, formative years in which he learned among
a myriad of other things the fluent use of French, then in 1865
we find him in the Roman Catholic college at Durham, England,
where came to him the first great tragedy of his life: an accident
at play that left him blinded in one eye and partly
blinded in the other. Soon afterwards came the break with his
aunt&mdash;father and mother had passed out of his life&mdash;he refused
to become a priest, refused to live longer in any paths save his
own, and for the rest of his life he was a wanderer.</p>

<p>There is much in his life and temperament to suggest De
Quincey. Hearn, too, for a vague period&mdash;two or three years it
may have been&mdash;wandered in the lower strata of London, half
dead with hunger and sickness, aflame with imagination, restless,
ambitious. At nineteen we find him in New York, reading
in the public library, eagerly, omnivorously, despite his
feeble vision, then suddenly, how we do not know, he is in Cincinnati,
Ohio, where he makes the whole city gasp with horror
at the story he writes of a murder in one of their narrow streets,
and secures a position on the <i>Enquirer</i>. In 1877 he has wandered
as far south as New Orleans, where for the first time in his
life he finds congenial atmosphere and where he supports himself
by reporting for the <i>Times-Democrat</i>.</p>

<p>Now it was that his French schooling had its effect. The
Creole <i>patois</i> delighted him; he compiled a book of Creole
proverbs, <i>Gombo Zhêbes</i> he fantastically called it; and he fed
his imagination with the old French past of the city, wandering
as Cable had done among its ancient buildings, and, like Cable
again, devouring its romantic old chronicles. French novels he
read interminably, eagerly, especially the romantics&mdash;Hugo,
Gautier, Baudelaire. How richly he read them we learn from
his letters, most of all from those written in his later life to
Professor Basil Hall Chamberlain and preserved in Elizabeth
Bisland's third volume. Few have read more discerningly or
have voiced their findings more brilliantly. This of Loti:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There is not much heart in Loti, but there is a fine brain.&mdash;To
me Loti seems for a space to have looked into Nature's whole splendid
burning fulgurant soul, and to have written under her very deepest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
and strongest inspiration. He was young. Then the color and the
light faded, and only the worn-out blasé nerves remained; and the poet
became&mdash;a little morbid modern affected Frenchman.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Strange self-revealment. It was of himself he was speaking,
had he but realized it. He too began with power under the
deepest and strongest inspiration; he too had caught a vision,
splendid, burning, fulgurant. If there was an undoubted genius
in our national period it was Hearn. He poured his eager
dreamings at first into the New Orleans papers: "Fantastics,"
they have been called, by the editor who of late has hunted them
from their forgotten columns. Then came <i>Chita</i>, written after
a visit to Grande Isle in the Gulf of Mexico and published first
in the <i>Times-Democrat</i> with the title <i>Torn Letters</i>, and then in
<i>Harper's Magazine</i>, April, 1888.</p>

<p>Here for the first time we get the measure of the man, his
Celtic imagination, fervor and intensity, his Greek passion for
beauty. It is not English at all: it is the dream of a Celtic
Greek, who has saturated himself with the French romantics
and the color and the profusion of the tropic gulf lands. It
is not, as the magazine termed it, a novelette; it is a loosely
gathered bundle of fictional sketches, lurid patches, "torn letters,"
indeed, written with torrential power and blazing with
color. Everywhere landscapes intense, drawn with fewest
strokes, impressions, suggestions. He would make you feel the
desolate shore on the gulf side of the island, but he selects only
a single detail:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The trees&mdash;where there are any trees&mdash;all bend away from the sea;
and even of bright hot days when the wind sleeps, there is something
grotesquely pathetic in their look of agonized terror. A group of oaks
at Grande Isle I remember as especially suggestive: five stooping silhouettes
in line against the horizon, like fleeing women with streaming
garments and wind-blown hair&mdash;bowing grievously and thrusting out
arms desperately northward as to save themselves from falling. And
they are being pursued indeed&mdash;for the sea is devouring the land.
Many and many a mile of ground has yielded to the tireless charging
of Ocean's cavalry.</p></blockquote>

<p>Always is he a colorist, and always does he use his colors
daintily, effectively, distinctively&mdash;one feels rather than sees:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The charm of a single summer day on these island shores is something
impossible to express, never to be forgotten. Rarely, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
paler zones, do earth and heaven take such luminosity: those will best
understand me who have seen the splendor of a West Indian sky.
And yet there is a tenderness of tint, a caress of color in these Gulf-days
which is not of the Antilles&mdash;a spirituality, as of eternal tropical
spring.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">It describes his own style; one need say no more.</p>

<p>When he would describe action there is in him a Byronic
power that lays hold on one and chokes and stifles. Who outside
of <i>Don Juan</i> has made us feel so fearfully a tropic hurricane?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Then arose a frightful cry&mdash;the hoarse, hideous, indescribable cry
of hopeless fear&mdash;the despairing animal-cry man utters when suddenly
brought face to face with Nothingness, without preparation, without
consolation, without possibility of respite. <i>Sauve qui peut!</i> Some
wrenched down the doors; some clung to the heavy banquet tables, to
the sofas, to the billiard tables&mdash;during one terrible instant&mdash;against
fruitless heroisms, against futile generosities&mdash;raged all the frenzy of
selfishness, all the brutalities of panic. And then&mdash;then came, thundering
through the blackness, the giant swells, boom on boom!&mdash;One
crash!&mdash;the huge frame building rocks like a cradle, seesaws, crackles.
What are human shrieks now?&mdash;the tornado is shrieking! Another!&mdash;chandeliers
splinter; lights are dashed out; a sweeping cataract hurls
in: the immense hall rises&mdash;oscillates&mdash;twirls as upon a pivot&mdash;crepitates&mdash;crumbles
into ruin. Crash again!&mdash;the swirling wreck dissolves
into the wallowing of another monster billow; and a hundred cottages
overturn, spin on sudden eddies, quiver, disjoint, and melt into the
seething.</p>

<p>So the Hurricane passed.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Chita</i>, like all the rest of Hearn's work, is a thing of fragments.
It leaps and bounds, it chokes with tropic heat, it blazes
with the sunsets of the Mexican gulf, it stagnates with torrid
siestas, it is raucous with the voices of tropic insects and birds.
It is incoherent, rhapsodic, half picture, half suggestion&mdash;materials
rather than final structure. The style is wholly Gallic,
like Cable's early style&mdash;sudden breaks&mdash;dashes&mdash;sentences
stripped to the bare nouns and adjectives, swift shiftings of
scenes, interjected exclamations, prayers:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Thou primordial Sea, the awfulness of whose antiquity hath stricken
all mythology dumb&mdash;thou most wrinkled living Sea, etc.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Then swiftly following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Eighteen hundred and sixty-seven;&mdash;midsummer in the pest-smitten
city of New Orleans.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span></p>
<p>Heat motionless and ponderous. The steel-blue of the sky bleached
from the furnace-circle of the horizon;&mdash;the lukewarm river yellow
and noiseless as a torrent of fluid wax. The nights began with a black
heat;&mdash;there were hours when the acrid air seemed to ferment for
stagnation, and to burn the bronchial tubing;&mdash;then, toward morning
it would grow chill with venomous vapors, with morbific dews&mdash;till the
sun came up to lift the torpid moisture, and to fill the buildings with
oven-heat. And the interminable procession of mourners and hearses
and carriages again began to circulate between the centers of life and
death;&mdash;and long trains of steamships rushed from the port with heavy
burden of fugitives.</p>

<p>Then terror that lays cold hands on the heart: Julian dying of fever.</p></blockquote>

<p>From New Orleans he went in 1887 to the Windward Islands
for new sensation, new color, new barbaric areas of human life.
<i>Two Years in the French West Indies</i> is the literary result of
it, a chaotic book, flashlights, impressions, but no single completed
impression, no totality, but the soul of the West Indies
none the less, revealed with a rare, queer art that was individual.
But no place, not even those Circe islands which he paints as
the dream and the ultimate of human desire, could detain him
long. Fickleness was in his blood, wandering was his birthright.
Again he is in New York, and then with a commission from the
Harpers he sails to Japan, where, in the rush and tumult of new
sensation, he forgets his commission and loses himself completely
in the new delicious world of impression.</p>

<p>For Hearn was as unpractical as Shelley and he was without
Shelley's ideals and altruistic dreams. He lived in a vague
world of vision, of sensation, of intangible beauty. He could
say of himself:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Always having lived in hopes and imaginations, the smallest practical
matters that everybody should know, I don't know anything about.
Nothing, for example, about a boat, a horse, a farm, an orchard, a
watch, a garden. Nothing about what a man ought to do under any
possible circumstances. I know nothing but sensation and books.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Though he was now forty, he entered this new world as one new
born into it. He adopted its costume, he slept with his head
on a wooden pillow, he acquired citizenship, he married a Japanese
wife and established a Japanese home, and he even went
over completely to the Buddhist religion.</p>

<p>The book <i>Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan</i>, 1894, marks the beginning
of his second literary period. Henceforth his writings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
center about Japan. He wrote no treatise, no serious study of
actual conditions; he wrote impressions, fragmentary suggestions
of the Japan that was passing away, the romantic Japan of the
ideal old régime, survivals of which he found everywhere.
Japanese art and Japanese romance found in him a curious
affinity. They mellowed and soothed the tumultuous spirit of
his first art period. His impressionism became more subtly suggestive,
more magically vague, more daintily colored. There
had always been within him a strong element of mysticism,
legacy of his Irish ancestry, and the subtly mystical side of
Buddhism appealed to it strongly. He was able to interpret it
for occidental comprehension, and he was able to make more
comprehensible the subtle connotation of Japanese art, and to
catch the subtler inner consciousness of Japan as no other of the
Western world has ever caught it. In his first enthusiasm he
wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is a land where one can really enjoy the Inner Life. Every
one has an inner life of his own&mdash;which no other life can see, and the
great secrets of which are never revealed, though occasionally when
we create something beautiful we betray a faint glimpse of it.</p></blockquote>

<p>But the newness of this new world he had entered wore away
at length. He was a creature of enthusiastic moments and he
needed swift changes of sensation. He had reveled in the old,
ideal Japan, but he found himself unable to live in it. A new
régime had begun. He was filled with contempt at what he
called "the frank selfishness, the apathetic vanity, the shallow,
vulgar skepticism of the new Japan that prates its contempt
about Tempo times, and ridicules the dear old men of the
premeiji era." His last years were bitter with financial embarrassment,
and full of feverish literary creation for the sake of
his growing family. The glow and fervor and genius of his
first period faded more and more from his work;&mdash;he himself
faded out. He felt the gulf that he had erected between himself
and his race. To his sister he wrote: "I feel myself in exile;
and your letters and photographs only make me homesick for
English life." He died of his own vehemence, worn out by
oversensation, unnerved by restlessness and nostalgia and longing
for he knew not what.</p>

<p>The likeness of Hearn to De Quincey is almost complete. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
had De Quincey's irresoluteness, his jangling nerves, his dominating
fancy, his discursiveness, his gorgeous imagination, his
oriental soul hampered with the fetters of occidental science.
He too was essentially fragmentary in his literary output, a man
of intense moods intensely painted, a man of books but of no
single, unified, compelling book. One may not read essays like
"Gothic Horror" or "The Nightmare Touch," or a passage
like this from "Vespertina Cognitio," and not think of the great
English opium-eater:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It must have been well after midnight when I felt the first vague
uneasiness&mdash;<i>the suspicion</i>&mdash;that precedes a nightmare. I was half-conscious,
dream-conscious of the actual&mdash;knew myself in that very
room&mdash;wanted to get up. Immediately the uneasiness grew into terror,
because I found that I could not move. Something unutterable in the
air was mastering will. I tried to cry out, and my utmost effort resulted
only in a whisper too low for any one to hear. Simultaneously
I became aware of a Step ascending the stair&mdash;a muffled heaviness; and
the real nightmare began&mdash;the horror of the ghastly magnetism that
held voice and limb&mdash;the hopeless will-struggle against dumbness and
impotence. The stealthy Step approached&mdash;but with lentor malevolently
measured&mdash;slowly, slowly, as if the stairs were miles deep. It
gained the threshold&mdash;waited. Gradually then, and without sound, the
locked door opened; and the Thing entered, bending as it came&mdash;a
thing robed&mdash;feminine&mdash;reaching to the roof, not to be looked at! A
floor-plank creaked as It neared the bed;&mdash;and then&mdash;with a frantic
effort&mdash;I woke, bathed in sweat; my heart beating as if it were going
to burst. The shrine-light had died: in the blackness I could see nothing;
but I thought I heard that Step retreating. I certainly heard
the plank creak again. With the panic still upon me, I was actually
unable to stir. The wisdom of striking a match occurred to me, but
I dared not yet rise. Presently, as I held my breath to listen, a new
wave of black fear passed through me; for I heard moanings&mdash;long
nightmare moanings&mdash;moanings that seemed to be answering each other
from two different rooms below. And then close to me my guide began
to moan&mdash;hoarsely, hideously. I cried to <span class="locked">him:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Louis!&mdash;Louis!"</p>

<p>We both sat up at once.</p></blockquote>

<p>Like De Quincey, he lingers over the flavor of words, gathering
them everywhere he may and gloating over them, tasting them
with half-closed eyes like an epicure, and using them ever delicately,
suggestively, inevitably.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>For me words have color, form, character: they have faces, ports,
manners, gesticulations; they have moods, humors, eccentricities;&mdash;they
have tints, tones, personalities.... Surely I have never yet made,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
and never expect to make any money. Neither do I expect to write
ever for the multitude. I write for beloved friends who can see color
in words, can smell the perfume of syllables in blossom, can be shocked
with the fine elfish electricity of words. And in the eternal order of
things, words will eventually have their rights recognized by the people.</p></blockquote>

<p>His essays, therefore, even as he has intimated, are for the
few who are attuned to them, who have sense for delicate suggestion,
for "the phosphorescing of words, the fragrance of
words, the noisomeness of words, the tenderness, the hardness,
the dryness or juiciness of words." Aside from his vision of
beauty, his intensity, his suggestiveness of style, he has brought
not much. The romancers of the period, a few of them, like
Grace King, for example, have felt his influence, but it has not
been a large one. He stands almost an isolated figure in his
period, an intensely individual soul, a solitary genius like Poe.
His place is a secure one. His circle of readers will never be
large, but it will always be constant.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Another phase of French influence one finds in the work of
Agnes Repplier, perhaps the leading writer of "the light essay"&mdash;the
term is her own&mdash;in the later years of the period. Born
of French parentage in Philadelphia, educated at a convent
where prevailed French language and ideals, she was Gallic both
by temperament and training. She was not influenced as Cable
undoubtedly was influenced and Hearn: there is small trace in
her essays of French style echoed consciously or unconsciously.
The influence was deeper, it was temperamental and racial, manifesting
itself spontaneously in the display of those literary
qualities that we associate with the word "French." Her
favorite reading was largely in the English. She read enormously
and she read note-book in hand. She added, moreover,
culture and impressions by much residence abroad, and when she
began to write it was with rich store of material. She began
deliberately and she worked like a true classicist, leisurely, with
no genius, and no message to urge her on. Her delight it was
to talk about her reading, to add entertaining episodes, to embroider
with witty observation and pithy quotation or epigram.
Save for the autobiographical study "In Our Convent Days,"
her writings mostly deal with the world of books.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
Miss Repplier first came into notice in 1886 when one of her
essays came to Aldrich, who was delighted with it and who made
haste to introduce her to the <i>Atlantic</i> circle. Two years later
came her first book, <i>Books and Men</i>, and since that time her
essays, goodly in number and scattered through many magazines,
have become a well-known feature of the times. Themes
she takes to suit her fancy, apparently at random, though more
often phases of her beloved "happy half century": "A Short
Defense of Villains," "Benefits of Superstition," "The Deathless
Diary," "The Accursed Annual," "Marriage in Fiction,"
and all other topics pertinent to Dr. Johnson's little world. She
adds not much to our knowledge, and she comes not often to
any new conclusions, but she is so companionable, so sparkling
and witty, that we can but read on with delight to the end. We
are in an atmosphere somehow of old culture and patrician
grace, of courtliness and charm:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thou mindest me of gentle folks&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Old gentlefolks are they&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou sayst an undisputed thing<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In such a solemn way.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>A little of feminine contrariness there may be, perhaps, at
times. A thing has been generally disparaged: she will defend
it. Richardson's Sir Charles Grandison may be mentioned:
"I think, myself, that poor Sir Charles has been unfairly handled,"
she will retort. "He is not half such a prig as Daniel
Deronda; but he develops his priggishness with such ample detail
through so many leisurely volumes." And her protest
becomes almost acrimonious if anything of the new be flippantly
boasted of as superior to the old:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We have long ago ceased to be either surprised, grieved, or indignant
at anything the English say of us," writes Mr. Charles Dudley
Warner. "We have recovered our balance. We know that since <i>Gulliver</i>
there has been no piece of original humor produced in England
equal to Knickerbocker's <i>New York</i>; that not in this century has any
English writer equaled the wit and satire of the <i>Biglow Papers</i>."</p>

<p>Does this mean that Mr. Warner considers Washington Irving to be
the equal of Jonathan Swift; that he places the gentle satire of the
American alongside of those trenchant and masterly pages which constitute
the landmarks of literature? "Swift," says Dr. Johnson, with
reluctant truthfulness, "must be allowed for a time to have dictated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
political opinions of the English nation." He is a writer whom we
may be permitted to detest, but not to undervalue. His star, red as
Mars, still flames fiercely in the horizon, while the genial luster of
Washington Irving grows dimmer year by year. We can never hope
to "recover our balance" by confounding values, a process of self-deception
which misleads no one but ourselves.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Realism, the new smartness of Western veritism, the cry that
romance is dead, and that Walter Scott is outworn, found in her
no sympathy. Her heart was in the eighteenth century rather
than in what she has called "this overestimated century of progress."
And so thoroughly convinced is she, it is impossible not
to agree with her:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Lord Holland, when asked by Murray for his opinion of <i>Old Mortality</i>,
answered indignantly: "Opinion? We did not one of us go to
bed last night! Nothing slept but my gout." Yet <i>Rokeby</i> and <i>Childe
Harold</i> are both in sad disgrace with modern critics and <i>Old Mortality</i>
stands gathering dust on our book-shelves.... We read <i>The Bostonians</i>
and <i>The Rise of Silas Lapham</i> with a due appreciation of their
minute perfections; but we go to bed quite cheerfully at our usual
hour, and are content to wait an interval of leisure to resume them.
Could <i>Daisy Miller</i> charm a gouty leg, or <i>Lemuel Barker</i> keep us awake
till morning?</p></blockquote>

<p>A paragraph like this may be said to contain all the various
elements of her style:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There are few things more wearisome in a fairly fatiguing life than
the monotonous repetition of a phrase which catches and holds the
public fancy by virtue of its total lack of significance. Such a phrase&mdash;employed
with tireless irrelevance in journalism, and creeping into
the pages of what is, by courtesy, called literature&mdash;is the "new
woman." It has furnished inexhaustible jests to <i>Life</i> and <i>Punch</i>, and
it has been received with all seriousness by those who read the present
with no light from the past, and so fail to perceive that all femininity
is as old as Lilith, and that the variations of the type began when Eve
arrived in the Garden of Paradise to dispute the claims of her predecessor.
"If the fifteenth century discovered America," says a vehement
advocate of female progress, "it was reserved for the nineteenth century
to discover woman"; and this remarkable statement has been
gratefully applauded by people who have apparently forgotten all
about Judith and Zenobia, Cleopatra and Catherine de Medici, Saint
Theresa and Jeanne d'Arc, Catherine of Russia and Elizabeth of England,
who played parts of some importance, for good and ill, in the
fortunes of the world.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Here is the note of dissent from the widely accepted; the appeal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
to antiquity; the pithy quotation; the allusion that takes for
granted a cultivated reader; the sprightly tripping of sentences;
the witty turn; and the atmosphere of feminine vivacity and
brilliance. Apt quotations sparkle from every paragraph.
Often she opens breezily with a quotation; she illustrates at
every point with epigrams and witty sayings from all known
and unknown sources; and she ends smartly by snapping the
whip of a quotation in the final sentence or paragraph.</p>

<p>The bent of her work, taking it all in all, is critical, and often
in her criticism, especially her criticism of literature, she rises
to the point of distinction. One may quote paragraphs here
and there that are as illuminating as anything in American
criticism. She is quick to see fallacies and to press an absurd
deduction to its ridiculous end. She illumines a whole subject
with a paragraph. This for example on Hamlin Garland:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. Hamlin Garland, whose leaden-hued sketches called&mdash;I think
unfairly&mdash;<i>Main-Traveled Roads</i> have deprived most of us of some
cheerful hours, paints with an unfaltering hand a life in which ennui
sits enthroned. It is not the poverty of his Western farmers that
oppresses us. Real biting poverty, which withers lesser evils with its
deadly breath, is not known to these people at all. They have roofs,
fire, food, and clothing. It is not the ceaseless labor, the rough fare,
the gray skies, the muddy barn-yards, which stand for the trouble in
their lives. It is the dreadful weariness of living. It is the burden
of a dull existence, clogged at every pore, and the hopeless melancholy
of which they have sufficient intelligence to understand. Theirs is the
ennui of emptiness, and the implied reproach on every page is that
a portion, and only a portion, of mankind is doomed to walk along
these shaded paths; while happier mortals who abide in New York, or
perhaps in Paris, spend their days in a pleasant tumult of intellectual
and artistic excitation.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">And few have put their criticism into more attractive form. It
is penetrating and true and in addition it has a sparkle and wit
about it that makes it anything but dry reading. Who has
written more sympathetically, more understandingly, more delightfully
about Charles Lamb than she if one takes her work
all together. Here is a glimpse, yet how illuminating:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Truest of all, is Charles Lamb who, more than any other humorist,
more than any other man of letters, belongs exclusively to his own
land, and is without trace or echo of foreign influence. France was
to Lamb, not a place where the finest prose is written, but a place
where he ate frogs&mdash;"the nicest little delicate things&mdash;rabbity-flavored.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
Imagine a Lilliputian rabbit." Germany was little or nothing, and
America was less. The child of London streets,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Mother of mightier, nurse of none more dear,"<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">rich in the splendid literature of England, and faithful lover both of
the teeming city and the ripe old books, Lamb speaks to English hearts
in a language they can understand. And we, his neighbors, whom he
recked not of, hold him just as dear; for his spleenless humor is an
inheritance of our mother tongue, one of the munificent gifts which
England shares with us, and for which no payment is possible save
the frank and generous recognition of a pleasure that is without a
peer.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">But critic in the sense that Paul Elmer More is a critic, she
certainly is not. She is temperamental rather than scientific.
She makes brilliant observations, but she has no system, no
patient analytical processes. She is, like Henry James, a critic
by flashes, but those flashes often illuminate the whole landscape.</p>

<p>She is a suggestive writer, a writer who makes her reader
think, who restores him as the dynamo restores the battery.
Her world is a small one and it is not necessarily American, but
it is intensely alive. In her own "happy half century," quoting
Dr. Johnson, discoursing of Fanny Burney or Hannah More,
or when telling of her cat or of the mystic lore of cats quoting
Montaigne and Loti, or of those still more feminine topics:
mirrors, spinsters, letters, the eternal feminine, she induces
"electrical tingles of hit after hit." Her work must be classed
with that of Lamb, of Loti, of Hearn, as work peculiarly personal,
work that makes its appeal largely on account of the
surcharged individuality behind it.</p>

<p>With Miss Repplier's essays may be classed those of Samuel
McChord Crothers (1857&mdash;&mdash;), Edward S. Martin (1856&mdash;&mdash;)
and Louise Imogen Guiney, who wrote for cultured people on
topics for the most part drawn from the world of books. The
work of Dr. Crothers is the most distinctive of the three. His
wisdom, his delicate humor, his unfailing sense of values have
made his papers, the most of them published in the <i>Atlantic</i>, a
source of real delight and profit to an increasing circle. His
books, like those of Miss Repplier, may be safely placed in the
trunk when one starts on his summer's vacation and can take
but few. They are wise, still books that one may live with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span></p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The period has abounded in critics from the first. The best
of Lowell's prose came in the years following the war, and all
of Stedman's was written after 1870. The great multiplication
of newspapers and the increasing number of magazines led more
and more to the production of book reviews. The <i>North American
Review</i> no longer said the last word about a book or an
author. In 1865 Edwin L. Godkin (1831&ndash;1902) founded the
New York <i>Nation</i> and contributed to it some of the most fearless
and discriminating work of the period; in 1880 Francis F.
Browne (1843&ndash;1913) founded the Chicago <i>Dial</i> and made its
reviews among the best in America; and in 1881 Jeannette L.
Gilder (1849&ndash;1916) and her brother, Joseph B. Gilder (1858&mdash;&mdash;),
established the New York <i>Critic</i>, a journal that for two decades
exerted a formative influence upon the period.</p>

<p>A few of the great numbers of book reviewers have done
worthy work, some of them even distinctive work, though most
of it lies buried now in the great ephemeral mass. Howells and
Aldrich, Horace E. Scudder (1838&ndash;1902) and Bliss Perry
(1860&mdash;&mdash;) in the <i>Atlantic</i>, Henry M. Alden (1836&mdash;&mdash;) in
<i>Harper's</i>, Maurice Thompson (1844&ndash;1901) in the <i>Independent</i>,
and Hamilton W. Mabie (1846&ndash;1916) in the <i>Outlook</i>, all did work
that undoubtedly helped to shape the period, but not much of
it may rank as permanent literature. It has been too often
journalistic: hastily prepared, a thing of the day's work.</p>

<p>Much fine criticism has come sporadically from pens consecrated
to other literary tasks. Nearly all of the major poets of
the period as well as the novelists and essayists have at one
time or another made excursions into the field, sometimes producing
only a brilliant bit of temperamental impressionism,
sometimes working out studies that are systematic and complete.
James, Howells, Whitman, Burroughs, Lanier, Crawford, Torrey,
John Fiske, Maurice F. Egan, Henry Van Dyke, George E.
Woodberry, James Brander Matthews have all added brilliant
chapters to the sum of American criticism, but none may be
called a critic in the sense Sainte-Beuve was a critic. Their
work has been avocational, fitful excursions rather than systematic
exploration.</p>

<p>During the later years of the period there has been but one
who may be called a critic in the broader sense of the term&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>scholarly,
leisurely of method, systematic, detached, literary in
style and finish&mdash;a critic and only a critic, Paul Elmer More,
whose <i>Shelburne Essays</i> are our nearest approach to those
<i>Causeries du Lundi</i> of an earlier age. His birth and education
in the West, in St. Louis, was an advantage at the start: it took
from his later criticism that New England-centered point of
view that is so evident in the work of critics like Richardson
and Barrett Wendell. The New England culture he got in
due time at Harvard, where he took two advanced degrees, and
he broadened his outlook still further by pursuing his studies in
European universities, returning at length to teach Sanscrit
at Harvard and later at Bryn Mawr. Oriental language was
his specialty. One catches the spirit of his earlier period by
examining his first publications, among them <i>A Century of
Indian Epigram</i>, "Translations or paraphrases in English verse
of a hundred epigrams and precepts ascribed to a Hindu sage."
This early enthusiasm for things oriental gave him a singularly
valuable equipment for criticism. It broadened his view: it
put into his hands the two opposite poles of human thought.
His essay on Lafcadio Hearn is illuminating, not only of Hearn
but of More himself. We can illustrate only lamely with fragments:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Into the study of these by-ways of Oriental literature he has carried
a third element, the dominant idea of Occidental science; and this element
he has blended with Hindu religion and Japanese æstheticism in
a combination as bewildering as it is voluptuous. In this triple union
lies his real claim to high originality....</p>

<p>Beauty itself, which forms the essence of Mr. Hearn's art, receives
a new content from this union of the East and the West....</p>

<p>Is it not proper to say, after reading such passages as these, that
Mr. Hearn has introduced a new element of psychology into literature?
We are indeed living in the past, we who foolishly cry out that the
past is dead. In one remarkable study of the emotions awakened by
the baying of a gaunt white hound, Mr. Hearn shows how even the
very beasts whom we despise as unreasoning and unremembering are
filled with an articulate sense of this dark backward and abysm of
time, whose shadow falls on their sensitive souls with the chill of a
vague dread&mdash;dread, I say, for it must begin to be evident that this
new psychology is fraught with meanings that may well trouble and
awe the student.</p>

<p>In the ghostly residuum of these psychological meditations we may
perceive a vision dimly foreshadowing itself which mankind for centuries,
nay, for thousands of years, has striven half unwittingly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
keep veiled. I do not know, but it seems to me that the foreboding
of this dreaded disclosure may account for many things in the obscure
history of the race, for the long struggle of religion against the observations
of science which to-day we are wont to slur over as only
a superficial struggle after all. In the haunting fear of this disclosure
I seem to see an explanation, if not a justification, of the
obscurantism of the early church, of the bitter feud of Galileo and the
burning of Giordano Bruno, of the recent hostility to Darwinism, and
even of the present-day attempt to invalidate the significance of this
long <span class="locked">contest.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>In another and a far more unusual way he qualified himself
for his high office of critic: he immured himself for two years
in solitude, with books as his chief companions, and it was in
this wilderness that the <i>Shelburne Essays</i>&mdash;Shelburne was the
name of the town of his hermitage&mdash;were born. His own account
is illuminating:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In a secluded spot in the peaceful valley of the Androscoggin I took
upon myself to live two years as a hermit, after a mild Epicurean
fashion of my own. Three maiden aunts wagged their heads ominously;
my nearest friend inquired cautiously whether there was any
taint of insanity in the family; an old gray-haired lady, a veritable
saint, who had not been soured by her many deeds of charity, admonished
me on the utter selfishness and godlessness of such a proceeding....
As for the hermit ... having found it impossible to educe
any meaning from the tangled habits of mankind while he himself
was whirled about in the imbroglio, he had determined to try the efficiency
of undisturbed meditation at a distance. So deficient had been
his education that he was actually better acquainted with the aspirations
and emotions of the old dwellers on the Ganges than with those
of the modern toilers by the Hudson or the Potomac. He had been
deafened by the "Indistinguishable roar" of the streets, and could make
no sense of the noisy jargon of the market <span class="locked">place.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>The period gave him time to read, leisurely, thoughtfully,
with no nervous subconsciousness that the product of that reading
was to be marketable. When he wrote his first papers he
wrote with no press of need upon him. He had evolved his own
notion of the function of literature and of the critic. This was
what he evolved: and it is worthy of study:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There is a kind of criticism that limits itself to looking at the thing
in itself, or at the parts of a thing as they successively strike the mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
This is properly the way of sympathy, and those who choose this way
are right in saying that it is absurd or merely ill-tempered to dwell on
what is ugly in a work of art, or false, or incomplete. But there is
a place also for another kind of criticism, which is not so much directed
to the individual thing as to its relation with other things, and
to its place as cause or effect in a whole group of tendencies. No
criticism, to be sure, can follow one or the other of these methods
exclusively, as no product of art can ever be entirely isolated in its
genesis or altogether merged in the current of the day. The highest
criticism would contrive to balance these methods in such manner that
neither the occasional merits of a work nor its general influence would
be unduly subordinated, and in so far as these essays fail to strike
such a balance&mdash;I wish this were their only failure&mdash;they err sadly from
the best <span class="locked">model.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>In the eight volumes now issued there are eighty-five essays
on topics as varied as George Crabbe, Hawthorne, Swinburne,
Walt Whitman, The Bhagavad Gita, Pascal, Plato, Nietzsche.
Nearly two-thirds of them all deal with representative English
writers; some fifteen have to do with Americans. In the criticizing
of them he has held steadfastly to the contention that
men of letters are to be viewed not alone as individuals but as
voices and as spiritual leaders in their generations. The soul
of literature is not art and it is not alone beauty. For decadents
like Swinburne he has small sympathy and he can even rebuke
Charles Lamb for "his persistent refusal to face, in words at
least, the graver issues of life." He takes his stand at a point
so elevated that only the great masters who have been the original
voices of the race are audible. He dares even to speak of
"the jaunty optimism of Emerson," and to suggest that his
confidence and serenity were all too often taken by his generation
for original wisdom.</p>

<p>The foundation of his work is religious&mdash;religious in the
fundamental, the oriental, sense of the word. He has been consistent
and he has been courageous. That America has a critic
with standards of criticism, an official critic in the sense that
Sainte-Beuve was official, and that as editor of the leading critical
review of America this critic has a dominating clientele and
a leader's authority, is one of the most promising signs for that
new literary era which already is overdue.</p>

<p>Simple typographical errors were corrected.</p>

<p>Punctuation and spelling variations within quotations likely are due to having
been written by different people, in some cases for literary effect, and have
not been changed. Such variations within the author's own text have been
regularized when a predominant preference was found, and otherwise have not
been changed.</p>

<p><a href="#PREFACE">Preface</a>, last line "State College, Pennsylvania,": this edition omitted the date
that appears on the next line in another edition: "July 31, 1915."</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_30">30</a>: Transcriber added a closing quotation mark after the end of the last line of
poetry on the page.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_42">42</a>: "wanted local color." probably was meant to end with a comma, not
with a full stop.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_89">89</a>: "Sketch Book, "Castilian Days" refers to John Hay's "Castilian
Days," which has been likened to a sketch book in other books.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_165">165</a>: footnote anchor following "globe affords." has no matching reference
in the source.  Based on content of nearby pages, it has been matched to the
same reference as the first footnote anchor on the same page and appears here
as [86].</p>

<p><a href="#CHAPTER_XV">Chapter XV</a> contains two Section "V"'s, and the following sections are
identified in the sequence beginning "VI".</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_441">441</a>: Index entry referring to "H.&nbsp;C. Clark" should be "Clark, C.&nbsp;H."
Some other index references do not exactly match their targets.  Index entries and references have not been verified.</p>
